the world is changing .
i feel it in the water .
i feel it in the world .
i smell it in the air .
a lot of what once was , is lost because nobody lives more , who remembers .
it started with the back of the big rings .
three were given the elves , the immortal , wisest and fairest of all creatures .
seven thinks , big bergleuten and handwerkern in their halls of rock .
and nine -- nine rings were given to people who were striving in particular .
because these rings bargen the force and the will to lead every people .
but they all cheated .
because a ring was made .
in mordor , in the flash-over of the mount doom forging of the dark lord sauron , the dark lord sauron be secretive a meisterring to mastery everyone else .
in this ring , his cruelty , his cattiness and his will , went to burdensome all life .
a ring to enslaving them .
the row came out of the courtship countries under the command of the ringes .
some made resistance .
one last alliance of people and elves moved to battle against mordor .
they fought on the hang for the freedom of freedom .
victory was close .
but the power of ringes was not to break .
it happened when all the hope of faded , that isildur , the king son , griped his father sword .
sauron , the enemy of the free peoples , was defeated .
the ring went to isildur , which had the opportunity to annihilating evil forever .
but the hearts of people are easily debauching .
and the ring of power has its own will .
he bespoke and brought him death .
and what couldn &apos;t have been accepted was lost .
history became legend . legend became myth .
and for 2,500 years , the ring was remembered .
until one day , he was looking for new carrier oil .
my treasure .
the ring fell into the substance of the creature in the hands of the misty mountains .
and there he decayed the ring .
he &apos;s got to me .
my own .
my favorites .
my own .
my treasure .
the ring gave gollum an unnatural life .
for 500 years he poisoned his mind .
and in the darkness of gollums cave , he was waiting .
darkness dropped over the forest &apos;s forest .
rumors became more than a shadow in the east . a nameless went would be .
and the ring felt that his time had come .
he verließgollum .
but what happened was something that the ring didn &apos;t mind .
it was found by the most unlikely creature .
what is that ?
a hobbit .
bilbo baggins from the meadow landscape .
a ring .
disappeared !
my sweetie is gone !
because , soon , the hobbits is going to determine the fate of everyone .
the meadow landscape 60 years later .
the street goes on and continues , away from the door , where she began to go far beyond land to place , i follow her , so good .
you come late .
a magician never gets too late , frodo baggins .
or too early .
it seems like it &apos;s kind of intended .
what joy to see you , gandalf !
how could i forget uncle bilbos &apos;s birthday .
what does the world do ?
tell me everything .
everything ?
you &apos;re too curious about a hobbit .
extremely unusual .
what should i tell you ?
life in the wider world is just the same as the last age .
a constant come and go .
hardly anyone is aware of the existence of hobbits .
which i &apos;m very grateful for .
the long awaited is solid .
how does the old blighter show ?
as i heard , it should be a particularly aggressive celebration .
you know bilbo .
here &apos;s all from the fact .
right after that taste .
half meadow landscape is invited .
you love .
he &apos;s leading what &apos;s in the shields .
all right . so good .
just held it for you .
before you auftauchtest , we were beutlins more respected people .
we were never most entangled in adventure .
if you think about the dragon with the dragon , i was barely involved .
i just threw your uncle out to the door .
whatever you &apos;ve done , you &apos;re officially giltst as cuss .
oh , really ?
a drip stamp , gandalf !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
i mean , my dear kid .
i also .
no , thank you .
no other visitors , gratulanten or distant relatives !
and what about very old friends ?
bilbo baggins .
my druther !
nice to see you . 111 years old .
is that believing ?
you &apos;re not a little bit aged .
come in !
welcome , welcome .
tea ? maybe something worse .
i &apos;ve got some bottles of old wingert . 1296 .
very good vintage .
almost as old as me .
it &apos;s got my father gekeltert .
what do you mean ? do we do one ?
just tea , thank you .
i expected you last week .
but you come and walk , as you can see .
always . i &apos;m a little unpreparedness .
i just have cold chicken and essiggurken .
there &apos;s cheese .
no , it &apos;s not good anymore .
we have himbeermarmelade , an apple pie .
but not much for the night table .
oh no , we &apos;re rescued !
it &apos;s another biskuitkuchen there .
i could roast slicer eggs .
just tea , thank you .
oh , of course .
bad if i eat ?
all right .
i &apos;m not at home !
i have to go away from this verflixten , never let you alone .
i want to see mountains again .
mountains , gandalf !
quiet place where i can finish my book .
oh , the tea .
then you want to do your plan ?
yeah .
everything is ready .
all the arrangements are hit .
frodo had suspicion .
of course he did .
he &apos;s a baggins , no einfältiger straffgürtel from steinbüttel .
you say it , right ?
he loves you very much .
i know .
he would come up with , i would ask him .
i think deep inside of the body is still frodo .
in the woods , the fields .
the small rivers .
i &apos;m old , gandalf .
you don &apos;t see it , but i feel deep in my heart .
i feel skinny .
sort of cadaverous , like butter elapsed too much bread .
i need a holiday .
very long holidays .
and i &apos;m probably not going to return .
i didn &apos;t think so .
old tobin tax .
the best leaves in southern quarter .
gandalf , my old friend , on those night , we &apos;ll still remember that .
nice to see you .
there we go , sam .
challenge to the dance .
i prefer nochn beer .
oh no .
go ahead .
there i was , the grace of the three furchterregenden suitcase on wheels .
they agreed about how to cook , whether or not they want to cook , or should they sit on us and squashing .
they argued so long about this , and it &apos;s because of the first sunlight to go through the treetop and turn them all into stone .
fast .
no , the big one .
like this -- it &apos;s got to stick in the ground .
it &apos;s in the ground . it &apos;s out there .
that was your idea .
watch , the dragon !
hellcat ? absurdism . there &apos;s no dragon for 1,000 years .
that was good .
let &apos;s get one !
meriadoc brandybock and peregrin tuk .
let me do it .
a speech , bilbo !
a speech !
my love kindest and boffins , tuks and brandybocks , grubers , pausbackens .
straffgürtels and stolzfußens .
today my 111 . birthday !
but unfortunately , einundelfzig years are far too short to live under this vortrefflichen hobbits .
i don &apos;t know half of you half as well as i want , and i like less than half of you like half the way you do it .
i did something .
it &apos;s a lot too long .
i &apos;m sorry! to have to manifest that this is the end !
i &apos;m going now .
i &apos;m going to tell you very much .
probably lives .
you &apos;re probably extremely smart .
come on , gandalf .
have you seen your faces ?
there are many zauberringe in the world , and there &apos;s no need to use carelessness .
it was just a little fun .
you &apos;re probably right again , like always .
you &apos;re going to have an eye on frodo , right ?
two eyes .
that &apos;s how often i can do without them .
i leave him all .
what about your ring ?
does he stay here ?
yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s in an envelope on the chimney piece .
no .
isn &apos;t that strange ?
why not ?
why not keep it ?
you should leave the ring , bilbo .
is it so hard ?
well , no .
and yes .
now , because it &apos;s so far , i don &apos;t like it anymore .
i found him !
no reason to be indignant .
that &apos;s your fault !
it &apos;s my .
my own .
my treasure .
honey ?
so it &apos;s been called before , but not by you .
what do you think i do with my stuff ?
you had the ring for long enough .
you want to do it .
don &apos;t consider me for a wizard lazier hustles .
i don &apos;t want to paste you .
i want to help you .
all the years we were friends .
familiarity me , like earlier .
give it up .
you &apos;re right , gandalf .
the ring needs to go to frodo .
it &apos;s already late .
the path is long .
yes , it &apos;s time .
you still have the ring in your pocket .
here &apos;s the end of the book .
and he lived happy after the end of his day .
you &apos;re going to be sure my dear friend .
lifetime , measured .
lifetime , thank you bilbo .
to our next meeting .
it &apos;s my .
my own .
my treasure .
mystery in darkness .
my treasure .
darling .
it &apos;s continued , right ?
he talked for so long . i thought it was a joke .
bilbos ring .
he went out to the elves and leave you .
with all his assets .
the ring belongs to you .
caching it good .
where do you want to go ?
i care about things .
what about things ?
ask . that &apos;s an answer .
you &apos;ve just come .
i don &apos;t understand that .
i don &apos;t .
hold it secret .
forbid good .
meadow landscape !
baggins !
the year &apos;s 3434 age .
these are the records of isildurs , the high king of gondor , about the fund of the power of power .
he came to me .
it &apos;s a ring .
he &apos;s seiein heirloom of my kingdom .
my descendants should be tied to his destiny , because i don &apos;t want to convoy the ring to the ring .
he &apos;s my treasure , even though i buy it with great pain .
the lines on the ring start collapsing .
the typeface , first as a red flame , has disappeared .
a secret that can only charge fire .
meadow landscape .
baggins .
there &apos;s no beutlins here .
they &apos;re all in hobbingen .
over there .
does none of it know ?
is he do a the world of good good ?
what do you do ?
hold your hand up .
it &apos;s very cool .
what do you see ?
you see what ?
nothing .
there &apos;s nothing .
wait .
there are lines .
some kind of elbisch .
i can &apos;t read it .
very few can do that .
it &apos;s the language of mordor that i don &apos;t want to talk about here .
in our language it means .
a ring to enslaving them , to find them all in the dark , and bind forever .
this is the ring , forged from the dark lord sauron in the fire of the mount doom .
isildur cut him from saurons hand and took him .
bilbo found him .
in gollums cave .
60 years , the ring was in bilbos bondage , elongated his life , didn &apos;t let him age .
but that &apos;s over .
evil comes into mordor .
the ring came up .
he belongs to his name .
but he was defeated .
sauron was defeated .
no , frodo .
the mind lived on .
his life &apos;s life is tied to the ring , and the ring stays .
sauron back .
his orcs have become more .
his stronghold barad-dúr is back in mordor .
sauron just takes this ring to chase all the countries in darkness .
he &apos;s looking for him .
get it .
all his thoughts are in him .
and the ring wished nothing to do when to return to the hand of his feat .
they &apos;re one , the ring and the dark ruler .
he can never find him .
all right .
we do it away .
we hide him and never mention him .
nobody knows where he is , right ?
or , gandalf ?
somebody knew that bilbo had the ring .
i was looking for the creature everywhere .
but the enemy was first discovered .
i weißnicht how long she folterten him .
but under thermonuclear scream and stammering , they realized two words .
meadow landscape .
baggins .
that &apos;s going to be herführen .
who is there ?
take him , gandalf !
take it !
no . you have to take it .
don &apos;t familiarity him .
i &apos;ll give him .
don &apos;t try me , frodo !
i don &apos;t like to take him .
not even to coffering him .
you understand , frodo . i would want to do good with this ring .
but through me , he would have a too big and appalling power .
but here it can &apos;t stay ! no .
it can &apos;t .
what do i have to do ?
you &apos;ve got to continue .
that &apos;s fast .
where ?
leave the meadow landscape .
go to bree .
and what about you ?
i &apos;m waiting for you in the gasthauszum bangs bangs .
is that ring safe ?
i don &apos;t know , frodo .
i can &apos;t say it .
i have to meet the top of my investiture .
he &apos;s wise and powerful . familiarity me , frodo .
he knows advice .
you &apos;re going to have to removal the name .
it &apos;s too dangerous outside of the auenlandes .
journey only on the days .
and beyond the street .
i just go across .
my rather frodo .
hobbits are really amazing creatures .
in a month , you can learn everything about them .
and 100 years later , you can even be surprised .
crouched .
in my barter , samweis gamdschie !
have you obeied ?
i never did .
i just cut the grass .
something late to cut grass !
i heard voices .
what have you heard ?
tell me ! nothing important .
i heard about a ring , a dark ruler .
please , sorry , nothing .
doesn &apos;t turn me into a most scandalous .
no ?
maybe not .
i &apos;ve made something better .
come on , samweis .
not lallygagging .
be careful , both of them .
the enemy has many scout .
birds , animals .
is he safe ?
never use it , because his power pulls out the servant of the dark position as a ruler .
always think of the ring to go back to his lord .
he wants to find .
it &apos;s so far .
what &apos;s so far ?
another step , and i &apos;m so far away from home as never before .
come on , sam .
bilbo has always said :
it &apos;s a dangerous thing to get out of your door .
you betrittst the road , and if you &apos;re not looking at your feet , you can &apos;t know where you wear you .
smoke goes up on the mount doom .
it &apos;s very time .
and gandalf of the gray riding ride after isengart and beseeched me for advice .
because that &apos;s why you came , right ?
my old friend .
saruman .
are you sure ?
without any doubt .
so the ring of power was found .
all the years he was in the meadow landscape .
right before my nose .
and yet , you didn &apos;t see it .
your preference for the leaves of the halblinge has come along the senses .
but it &apos;s still time to defeat sauron if we act quickly .
time ?
how much time do you think we have ?
sauron has recovered a lot of its former strength .
yet , he can &apos;t adopt a shape , but his mind has nothing to do .
hidden in his womb , the lord of mordor sees everything .
look at gored clouds , shadow , soil and meat .
you know what i &apos;m talking about , gandalf ?
a big eye , lidlos , framed of flames .
yeah . sauron .
he gathered all evil around .
soon , his army will be strong enough to attack mittelerde .
you know ?
where ?
i saw it .
a palantír is a dangerous tool , saruman .
why should we eschewing it ?
it &apos;s still outstanding where the anderensehenden steinesind .
we don &apos;t know who else is watching .
the time you think about it faster than you think .
saurons force is on the road .
the nine have left minas morgul .
they were crossing the river isentropic at the mittsommerabend in the form of black reitern .
they &apos;re in the meadow landscape ?
you &apos;ll find the ring .
and they kill those who carry it .
frodo !
did you really think a hobbit came up against the will ?
there is nobody who &apos;s going to drive that .
the power of mordor can &apos;t be victory .
we need to engage with him , gandalf .
we need to be creative .
it would be smart , my friend .
tell me , my friend , since when does saruman the sense of reason ?
i gave you the opportunity to help me out of free , but you choose for the pain .
i thought i &apos;d lost you .
what are you talking about ?
gandalf said that .
what did he say ?
don &apos;t loss prevention device him , samweis gamdschie . i won &apos;t .
we &apos;re still in meadow landscape .
what can happen to us ?
merry , this is frodo baggins .
down from him !
what do you do here ?
you stole a farmer maggots !
out of my field !
why does he act like this ?
it &apos;s just a few beet slices .
and kohlköpfe .
and the three bag of potatoes last week .
and the mushrooms in the week before .
yeah , pippin .
let me tell you . he &apos;s responding completely .
run !
that was scarce .
i think i &apos;ve broken something .
typical brandybock and tuk !
what ?
that was just a shortcut .
germany .
where ?
fungi !
let &apos;s go down the street .
go down the street !
fast !
silent !
what was that ?
you see what ?
nothing .
what &apos;s going on ?
the black rider was looking for anything .
anyone .
crouched you !
i have to leave the meadow landscape .
sam and i have to go to bree .
understand .
bockenburger ferry .
follow me .
follow me !
go off the tau , sam !
run , frodo !
fast !
where do you get over ?
over the brandywein-brücke . 20 miles .
come on .
what do you want ?
we want instänzelnde bangs .
hobbits .
four hobbits .
what &apos;s going to lead you to bree ?
we want to stay in the inn sleep .
the reason is our thing .
all right , young lord .
it wasn &apos;t malevolent .
after breaking the night i have to ask .
are strange people on the road .
you can &apos;t be careful enough .
sorry .
good evening , my little gentlemen .
if you look for housing , you &apos;re still nice , cosier room in hobbit-größe .
mr. ?
unterberg .
my name is unterberg .
unterberg .

you drink it from krügen ?
i &apos;m going to get one .
you &apos;ve had a whole half .
the guy staring at you since we &apos;re here .
sorry .
the guy in the corner .
who is that ?
one of the waldläufern .
dangerous people , wanderndes people .
i don &apos;t know his proper name , but it &apos;s called streicher .
streicher .
baggins .
baggins .
baggins .
clearly i know a baggins .
there he is .
my favorite two degree , my on the distaff side , and my favorite three degree .

i see you .
there is no life in nothing .
only death .
her excitement alertness , mr. unterberg .
what do you want ?
you don &apos;t have a little bit of a difference with you .
i don &apos;t wear anything . of course .
i can avoid that you can see me , but to disappear , is a rare gift .
who are you ?
do you fürchtest ?
yeah .
by far , not enough .
i know who &apos;s tracking you .
leave him alone , long misery !
you have a wackeres heart , smaller .
but it doesn &apos;t save you .
no longer on the magician , frodo .
they come .
who are you ?
once they were people .
great kings of people .
then sauron of the back-stabber gave you the nine rings of power .
blind before acquisitiveness they took them to ask them .
and they fell into darkness .
now they &apos;re slaves of their willing .
they are the nazgûl .
ringgeister .
neither alive nor alive .
at all times , they feel the presence of ringes , driven by the power of one .
they &apos;re going to hunt forever .
where does it take us ?
in the wild .
how do we know that streicher is a friend of mine ?
we need to trust him .
but where does it take us ?
after bruchtal , mr. gamdschie .
elronds home .
do you hear that ?
after bruchtal .
we &apos;ll see the elves .
we stop at the night .
what about breakfast ? what did you do .
the first one , yes .
what about the second breakfast ?
i don &apos;t think he knows this , nonsense .
and the 11-uhr-imbiss ?
lunch ?
4-uhr-tee ?
dinner ?
evening meal ?
he knows that , right ?
don &apos;t expect with that .
the power is ready for you , sauron , lord of the earth .
give me an army worthy of mordors .
new instructions from mordor , my commander ?
what drives the eye ?
there &apos;s work .
the trees are strong , my commander .
their roots go deep .
rips everybody out .
this was the wachturm of amon sûl .
so here we are tonight .
they are for you .
they always carrier bag with you .
i &apos;ll see myself .
there it is .
what do you do ?
tomatoes , sausage , crisper bacon .
it &apos;s also what it is .
do that , your looby !
ashes on my tomatoes !
up .
back , your devils !
help him , streicher .
a morgulklinge has injured him .
i don &apos;t have my art of healing .
it needs elbische medicine .
fast !
it &apos;s six tagesmärsche to bruchtal ! it never makes it .
hang on , frodo .
it gets very cold .
will he die ?
he enters over into the shadow world .
soon , he &apos;s a mind like her .
they &apos;re very close .
do you know the athelas-pflanze ?
königskraut .
yeah , that &apos;s a weed control .
it keeps the contamination . hurry! .
a ranger that &apos;s not on the hat ?
i &apos;m a arwen .
i come to help you .
hear my voice .
come back to light !
who is she ?
it &apos;s a elbenfrau .
he wanes .
it doesn &apos;t make it long .
let &apos;s bring him to my father .
i &apos;ve been looking for two days .
five ringgeister are behind you .
where the other four are , i don &apos;t know .
stay in the hobbits .
i &apos;ll send you horses .
i bow faster .
the road is too dangerous .
what are they talking about ?
when i cross the river , the power of my people will protect him .
i &apos;m not afraid .
bow fast . don &apos;t look back .
what are you doing ?
the ringgeister are still there !
give us the halflin halfling , elbenweib !
you want it , come on and demand him .
frodo , no .
frodo , don &apos;t give up .
not now .
the grace that i found may go to him .
close to it .
save it .
where am i ?
you &apos;re in elronds houses .
it &apos;s 10 o &apos;clock morning october of october 24 , if you want to know .
yeah , i &apos;m here .
and you &apos;re lucky that you &apos;re here .
a few hours , and we couldn &apos;t have help you .
but you have some force in you , rather than hobbit .
what &apos;s happening , gandalf ?
why didn &apos;t you come ?
sorry , frodo .
i got arrested .
the friendship sarumans is not carelessness .
a bad twist is the other value .
it &apos;s over .
choose the power of ringes , or choose your own doom .
lord of the ringes .
he &apos;s just going to win that the ring bends his will .
and he doesn &apos;t share his power .
so you wählst death .
what do you have ?
nothing , frodo .
how beautiful , you &apos;re awake .
sam shrimp is barely by your side .
we were frightened of you , right ?
thanks to the arts of elrond , you slow down .
welcome to bruchtal , frodo baggins .
hello , frodo , my boy .
back and back .
the story of a hobbits . proceed baggins .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i wanted to go back to see the miracle düsterwalds , visit maritime city , see the lone mountain again .
but as it seems , i &apos;m going to stop now .
i miss the meadow landscape .
in my childhood , i was like , i continue .
you know , continue to experience adventure together .
my own adventure then looked very different .
i &apos;m not like you , bilbo .
my dear kid .
what did i forget ?
you &apos;ve been packed ?
i just want to be prepared .
you know , you wanted to see the elves .
right .
more than anything .
yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s just .
we did what gandalf wanted , not ?
we brought the ring to bruchtal .
and i thought , well , i &apos;m going to take you better , let &apos;s stop .
home .
you &apos;re right , sam .
we &apos;ve done what we should do .
the ring will be safe in bruchtal .
i &apos;m ready to go home .
it comes again to forces .
the wound will never quite be healed .
he &apos;s wearing it as long as he lives .
and yet , he has come far along with the ring , and he was extremely resilient to the evil .
this burden would never have allowed him to be allowed .
you can &apos;t demand from him .
the enemy stops .
saurons force is in the east .
his eye looks at bruchtal .
and saruman may tell us .
the list of our followers is short .
sense of being is more than you know .
idles orcs has saruman orcs with bilwißmenschen crossed .
he grows an army in the verliesen isengarts .
it &apos;s an army that is also growing up and forth in sunlight .
saruman wants to get the ring .
even the power of elves is not grown by evil .
we &apos;re missing the force to fight mordor and isengart !
the ring can &apos;t stay here .
this threat is entirely mittelerde .
you have to decide how to address your face .
the time of elves is over .
my people leave this bank .
who will you turn to ?
the dwarfs ?
they &apos;re looking for wealth .
they don &apos;t care about the other .
in humans , we need to have our hope .
people .
people are weak .
people &apos;s people failed .
the blood of númenor is feebleness , all his pride and his dignity .
because of the outlasts , the ring is the time .
i was there , gandalf .
i was there 3,000 years ago , and when isildur took the ring .
i was there as the strength of the people .
isildur ! quick !
follow me .
i led isildur to the heart of the mount doom where the ring had been forged .
it was only there . throw it into the fire !
annihilator him ! no .
it should have stopped , but evil was allowed to continue .
isildur kept the ring .
the line of kings is interrupted .
there is no strength in the world of people .
they &apos;re absence of mind , estranged , chiefless .
only one could unite them .
one who could get back to the throne .
he went off a long time ago .
he chose the exile .
the geborstene sword narsil .
the blade , which is cut the ring of saurons hand .
it &apos;s even sharp .
just a zerbrochenes heirloom .
why do you fürchtest the past ?
you &apos;re isildurs legacy , not isildur itself .
you &apos;re not bound to your destiny .
the same blood flows through my veins .
same weakness .
your time will come .
you &apos;re going to face the same evil evil .
and you will beat it .
the shadow has no power yet .
neither about you nor me .
do you remember our first encounter ?
i felt a dream .
for a long years , since then .
don &apos;t worry about that at the time .
do you know what i said at the time ?
you said you would take the union with me , and you would abdicate the immortality of your people .
and i &apos;m stuck with that .
one single life with you than all the ages of the world alone .
that &apos;s how i choose a sterbliches life .
you can &apos;t give me .
you &apos;ve been called over to defy the threat of mordors .
mittelerde stands on the edge of the mass mass .
nobody can avoid it .
ally you , or you &apos;re under .
every people is being at the mercy of that fate , on thriving and decay .
hole out of the ring , frodo .
so it &apos;s true .
he &apos;s a gift .
a gift to adversary mordors .
why not use it ?
for a long time , my father , the truchseß of gondor , fended force .
with the blood of our people , we defend your countries .
give gondor the weapon of the enemy .
let &apos;s use it against him .
you can &apos;t use it .
nobody can .
it &apos;s a ring of obeied sauron alone .
he &apos;s just dominated him .
and what does a ranger of these things understand ?
it &apos;s more than that .
this is aragorn , arathorns son .
you &apos;re a obligated party .
so that &apos;s isildurs legacy ?
and heir to the throne from gondor .
sit down , legolas .
gondor has no king .
gondor doesn &apos;t need king .
aragorn is right .
we can &apos;t use it .
there &apos;s only one way .
the ring needs to be annihilated .
what are we waiting for ?
the ring can &apos;t be destroyed , gimli , glóins son , none of the art that we master .
in the firing of the mount doom , it can only be wiped out there .
you have to get it deep to mordor , and in the fierier abyss , which he comes from .
one of you must do that .
you don &apos;t just go to mordor .
his black gates are becoming by schlimmerem guarded than just orcs .
the evil there never sleeps .
and the great eye is always most watchful .
it &apos;s a karges badlands , cloyingly with fire , ashes and dust .
the air you breathe is toxic steam .
not with 10,000 husband , you could do that .
it &apos;s insane .
don &apos;t you hear your mr. elrond ?
the ring needs to be annihilated .
and you think you &apos;re the one who does it !
and now if it &apos;s fails ? when sauron , what is it hearing ?
rather , i want to die when to see the ring in the hands of a elves .
nobody courage a elves !
don &apos;t you guess ?
as your herumzankt , it grows saurons !
nobody entrinnt her !
you &apos;re all annihilates !
i &apos;ll take it .
i &apos;m going to bring the ring to mordor .
although i don &apos;t know the path .
i &apos;ll help you carry the burden as long as it might be imposed .
i can protect you through life or death , i &apos;ll do it .
you have my sword .
and you have my bow .
and my ax .
you bestimmst our fate , little .
if this is the will of the addicted to guessing , it &apos;s gondor .
mr. frodo is walking without me .
it &apos;s not possible to separate you , even if it &apos;s invited to a secret counseling and you &apos;re not .
we &apos;re coming with !
or you need to put us in a bag of ties up send home .
you need people with minds for this task .
search .
thing .
and then you &apos;re hour of parting , nonsense .
nine companions .
that &apos;s it .
you form the community of ringes .
great .
where do we go ?
my old sword .
clean .
take it .
it &apos;s so easy .
yeah .
the elves have forged it .
the blade gleams blue , when orcs are near .
and in times like this , you have to be very careful .
here &apos;s what beautiful .
mithril .
it &apos;s just like a feather and hard adjectives .
legs time .
my old ring .
i &apos;d like to put it in the hand , last time .
i &apos;m sorry i have the imposed .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re wearing this burden now .
i &apos;m sorry .
we have to follow the rfad west of the nebelgebirges 40 days .
if we &apos;re lucky enough , the rforte will be open to us .
from there , we bending towards mordor .
good !
very good .
move your feet .
not bad , pippin .
faster !
i would ask anybody to ask me what nobody does , i would suggest , we circuit a circuit .
we could go through the mines .
my cousin balin would receive us kinglike .
no . i was only going through moria , i would have no other choice .
on him !
- !
shut it up , merry .
what is that ?
just a wolkenfetzen .
but it &apos;s moving fast .
and against the wind .
crebain from dunland !
hide you !
in covering up !
scout sarumans .
they observe the way to south .
we need to take the passport of the caradhras .
strange skill makes us so scared and doubts because of such a small dinges .
this is a little thing .
give frodo the ring .
you want .
i &apos;m the same .
well , gandalf , you &apos;re trying to get you to the caradhras .
and if the fehlschlägt , which way can you choose ?
if the mountain defeated you , you would be dares away .
it &apos;s bad voices in the air .
this is sarunam !
it takes the mountain to collapse .
we have to reverse !
no !
we have to leave the mountain !
on the gate of rohan , and about the west-fold to my city .
the gate of rohan takes us too close to isengart .
we can &apos;t .
let &apos;s go through it .
let &apos;s go through the mines of moria .
you fürchtest in front of these mines .
the dwarfs have become greedy and too digged .
you know what they aufweckten in the darkness of khazad-dûm .
shadow and light .
let &apos;s decide the ring bearer .
we go through the mines .
that &apos;s it .
the walls of moria .
well , let &apos;s see .
ithildin .
it &apos;s just a starlight or a flashlight .
here &apos;s the doors of durin , the lord of moria .
go , friend , and come in .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;re a friend , say the catch-word , and the door will open .
mines are not a place for bangs .
not even for the brave lutz .
farewell , lutz .
with you .
don &apos;t worry , sam . he knows the way home .
don &apos;t frightening the water .
no , it &apos;s pointless .
it &apos;s a mystery .
talk , friend and juggling .
how heißtfreundauf elbisch ?
mellon .
soon , elbenherr , you learn the famous hospitality of the dwarfs .
prasselnde ingle , malzbier , good abgehangenes meat !
this , my friend , is balin home .
and they call it einemine .
einemine !
this is not a mine .
it &apos;s a grave .
these were bilwißmenschen .
on the gate of rohan .
we would never be here .
let &apos;s go from here .
out !
in the mines !
legolas !
run !
we only have one option .
we have to take it with the long darkness .
be on the hat !
there are older and gemeinere creatures as orcs in the deep world .
quiet now .
we need four days to the other side .
hopefully our present is missing .
i don &apos;t remember that one .
did we run ?
i think so .
gandalf thinks .
what ?
i was hungry .
there &apos;s something down there .
this is gollum .
he follows us for three days .
he moved out of the verliesen of barad-dûr ?
or oil was released .
he hates and loves the ring , like he hates himself and loves .
his desire for him will never be expiration .
a bitchiness that bilbo didn &apos;t kill him at the time .
it was pity to zurückhielt the bilbos hand .
many who live , deserve death .
some people die , they deserve life .
can you give it to you , frodo ?
not so fast with a death sentence at hand .
because even the species don &apos;t recognize all the intentions .
my heart tells me that gollum has a role to play -- for good or evil -- before everything ends .
bilbos pity likes to determine the fate of many .
i wish i could never have the ring , and all that would never have happened .
that &apos;s what all of these things are doing .
but you don &apos;t choose to do that .
we just have to decide what we &apos;re going to do with the time that we &apos;re given .
it &apos;s different forces , not just the power of evil .
bilbo was destine to find the ring , as well as you were destine .
and this is a ermutigender thought .
there we go .
he remembers .
but here , the air stinker not like that .
in the case of doubt , meriadoc , always your nose .
let me give you a little bit more light .
see ! the big empire and the city zwergenbinge .
a true eye-opener , no question .
here lies balin balin , fundins son , lord of moria .
so he &apos;s dead .
i had feared .
we need to continue .
we &apos;re not allowed to stay .
they took the bridge and the second hall .
we have the gates obstructs , but we can &apos;t keep them long .
the earth quakes .
drums . drums in the depth .
we can &apos;t move out .
a shadow moves in the darkness .
we can &apos;t move out .
they come .
närrischer tuk !
throw out yourself , so you don &apos;t do any trouble .
orcs .
back . leave behind gandalf !
they have a höhlentroll .
should you come .
there &apos;s a dwarf in moria that breathes .
slowly , i &apos;ll get the handle out .
oh , no .
he lives .
i don &apos;t have anything .
i &apos;m a in one piece .
you had to be dead .
the shock had a wild eber impaled .
there &apos;s more on this hobbit than the eye sees .
mithril .
you have full surprises , mr. baggins .
to bridge khazad-dûm .
what is this new devilment ?
a balrog .
a demonised of the old world .
this enemy is all thinking about you .
run !
fast !
keep running , aragorn .
the bridge is close .
do what i say !
crossed swords mark are nothing more .
nobody throws a dwarf .
not on the beard !
caution !
wait !
hang on !
bends forward !
caution .
over the bridge !
flees !
you can &apos;t go over !
i &apos;m a servant of the secret fire , commander over the flame of abnormality .
the dark fire will not make you good , blaze by udûn !
go back to the shadows .
you can &apos;t go over !
flees , you fools .
no !
legolas , high with them .
let &apos;s give you some time .
when it gets dark , it &apos;s all over here .
we need to go into the forests of forests .
come on , boromir .
legolas , gimli , help you .
stand up , sam .
stay near , young hobbits !
you say a big enchantress lives in these forests .
a elbenhexe of horrifyingly power .
everybody you see , sink beneath the weight of your spell .
and never seen again .
you come to us as a forerunner of destiny .
you take that evil to us , ring bearer .
after all , there &apos;s a dwarf that doesn &apos;t make it so easily .
i have the eyes of a hawk nose and the ears of a fuchses .
the dwarf breathes is so loud , we could have shot it in the dark .
haldir of lórien .
we come to petition help .
we need your protection .
these forests are dangerous .
we should reverse .
you &apos;ve entered the realm of the forest . you can &apos;t reverse .
come on .
she would expect you .
here &apos;s eight , eight are broken by bruchtal .
tell me where is gandalf ?
because it requires me to talk to him .
it goes down to the shadows .
your ride stands on a knife thrust .
just take a weniges , and it &apos;s going to fail , which means the decline of everybody .
and yet hope is true as the community is true .
let &apos;s not make your heart hard .
you &apos;re supposed to sit , you &apos;re exhausted for so much grief and scourge .
at the present day night nightcap her in peace ...
welcome , frodo from the meadow landscape who saw the eye .
a dirges for gandalf .
what do you say about him ?
my heart doesn &apos;t make it translate .
to me , grief is still too close .
sleep a little bit .
these boundaries are do a the world of good .
i don &apos;t find any sleep .
i heard her voice in my head .
she was talking about my father and the case .
she said , even now there is hope .
but i don &apos;t see them .
it &apos;s long ago that we were hoping .
my father is a edler man , but a weak ruler , and our people are losing trust .
i want to turn it all for him . that would be me .
i would go back to light .
have you ever seen him , aragorn ?
the white tower ecthelions ?
brilliant like a prickle of beads and silver .
his flag , bright in morgenwind .
have you ever heard the bright sound trumpet-like trumpet-like ?
i saw the white city a long time ago .
and one day , our way will lead us .
and this is a tower called resound .
the lord gondors are back .
are you looking in the mirror ?
what am i going to see ?
it doesn &apos;t always know the wisest , because the mirror shows a lot of things .
things that were . things that are . and things .
i know what you &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;ll take the same thing .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen when you get away .
the community breaks down .
it already started .
he &apos;s going to try to take him .
you know who i &apos;m talking about .
in a row , he &apos;s going to annihilating them all .
if you require it , i want to give you a ring .
you give him gratuitousness ?
i don &apos;t know that my heart has really taken this .
instead of a dark position as a ruler , you would have a queen , not dark , but beautiful and appalling like the morning !
deceitful like the lake !
more than the foundations of the earth !
everybody will love me and to despair .
i &apos;ll give the exam .
i &apos;m going to get weaker and go to the west .
and stay galadriel .
i can &apos;t do that alone .
you &apos;re a ring bearer , frodo .
wearing a ring , means to be alone .
this task is defined for you .
and if you don &apos;t find any way , nobody finds it .
then i know what i need to do .
it &apos;s just -- i &apos;m afraid of it .
even the smallest can change the course of destiny .
do you know how the orcs erblickten the world ?
they were elves , but they were tortured by the dark powers and mutilated .
an destroyed and horrible life form .
full of it .
my kämpfender uruk-hai ! who are you dienest ?
saruman .
click on !
until you found them !
you don &apos;t know fear nor pain .
you &apos;re going to cost human flesh !
one of the halblinge carries something very valuable .
bring them alive and safe .
kills the other .
i &apos;ll give you the light , our beloved star .
may you be a light in dark places when all the other lights go out .
the argonath .
finally , i see the kings of the altvorderen .
my ancestors .
we cross the lake at night , we hide the boats and we travel .
we &apos;re approaching mordor from north .
so we only have to fight through the emyn muil , a maze from messerscharfen rock .
and then it gets better .
schwärende , stinkende sumpflandschaft , so far the eye .
that &apos;s our way .
nightcap a little bit and recovered , dominates .
recovered !
let &apos;s stop .
no .
orcs guard the east bank .
let &apos;s wait until it &apos;s dark .
i &apos;m not worried about the east bank .
a more threatening shadow of mine .
something pulls up .
i feel it .
a dwarf doesn &apos;t have to recover .
just not notice , young hobbit .
where is frodo ?
no one should be alone .
you don &apos;t .
so much depends on you .
i know why you seek the loneliness .
you quälst .
i see it day for day .
don &apos;t you cut you unnecessary ?
there are other ways , frodo .
other pathways that we can choose .
i know what you want to say .
it would be like my heart didn &apos;t bother me .
warning ?
what ?
we all have fear , frodo .
but by fear to destroy hope , it &apos;s insane .
there &apos;s no other way .
i just want the strength to defend my people !
do you send me the ring ...
no !
i &apos;m not a burglar .
you &apos;re not yourself .
what &apos;s the story you &apos;ve got ?
you &apos;ll find yourself .
they take the ring .
and you &apos;re going to highlight death !
more cursed goop !
an f chance gave him .
he could have been mine .
he should be my !
give him me !
give me .
no .
i know what you have in mind .
you want to bring your ring to the ring !
you want to tell us !
you &apos;re going to go to the arms and you &apos;re going to take it all over us .
i cursing you !
you and all halblinge !
what did i do ?
please , frodo .
frodo ! i &apos;m sorry !
he has boromirs bemächtigt .
where is the ring ?
stay away !
i swore to protect you .
even before you ?
would you destroy it ?
i &apos;d gone to the end with you .
up into the fire .
i know .
join the other .
especially sam .
he won &apos;t understand it .
go , frodo .
run !
find the halblinge !
aragorn , run .
hide here !
come on .
what did he do ?
he leaves us .
no !
run , frodo .
hey , you go there !
here we are !
here !
it works !
i see that !
horn gondors .
run !
they have the little !
hang on .
where is frodo ?
i let him draw .
you &apos;ve done what i couldn &apos;t do .
i wanted to take him off the ring .
the ring is elusiveness now .
forgiveness me .
i couldn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve all told you .
no , boromir .
you fought bravest .
you &apos;ve got your honor .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s over .
human beings are be destroyed .
everything engulfs in darkness . my city falls into rubble .
i don &apos;t know what force i have , but i swear to you , neither the white city , still our people are failing .
our people .
i would follow you , my brother .
my hauptmann .
my king .
peace is with you , son gondors .
i wish i could never have the ring .
and all of that would have happened .
that &apos;s what all of these things are going to experience . but they don &apos;t choose to do that .
you just have to decide what you &apos;re going to do with the time that you &apos;re given .
frodo , not !
no , sam .
go back , sam !
i &apos;m just going to mordor .
of course .
and i come with you !
you can &apos;t swim !
i promised acquisitive , mr. frodo .
promised .
don &apos;t loss prevention device him , samweis gamdschie .
and i &apos;m not going to .
i &apos;m not going to .
come .
fast !
frodo and sam have reached the eastern bank .
you don &apos;t want to follow them .
frodos fate is no longer in our hand .
then everything was free .
the community failed .
it &apos;s not when we connect true .
we leave merry and pippin not torture and death .
not as long as we have power .
let &apos;s do everything here .
just light baggage .
let &apos;s chase orcs .
the others may find a safer way .
streicher will take care of them .
we &apos;ll probably never see them again .
maybe , mr. frodo .
maybe .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re at me .
you can &apos;t go over !
gandalf !
i &apos;m a servant of the secret fire , commander over the flame of abnormality .
back into the shadows !
the dark fire will not make you good , blaze by udûn !
you can &apos;t go over !
no !
no !
gandalf !
flees , you fools !
no !
gandalf !
gandalf !
what do you have , mr. frodo ?
nothing .
i forgot .
can you see the floor ?
no , not look down , sam !
just weiterklettern !
start ' .
stop , mr. frodo !
mr. frodo !
i think i found the ground .
bog and ropes and knows the cuckoo whistle , which is still .
that &apos;s not natural .
all of that .
what &apos;s in there ?
there &apos;s nothing . ' n little things to taste .
for the case , we &apos;re eating a brathähnchen or something .
a brathähnchen ?
you can never know .
sam , my good sam !
that &apos;s very special .
the best salt in meadow landscape .
it &apos;s really something special .
a piece of home .
we can &apos;t hierlassen that ; it could give us a hinunterfolgen .
who should runterfolgen us here , mr. frodo ?
actually , a bitchiness woman gave it to me .
real elbenseil .
well , you can &apos;t do anything .
the knot comes from me .
so fast , it certainly isn &apos;t .
real , real elbenseil .
mordor !
the only place in mittelerde that we don &apos;t want to see from close .
and that &apos;s the place we &apos;re looking for .
we can &apos;t get to that .
don &apos;t do anything , mr. frodo . we &apos;ve lost .
i don &apos;t think gandalf had planned this way for us .
there &apos;s a lot of things he didn &apos;t plan , sam . but it &apos;s happening .
mr. frodo ?
it &apos;s the ring , right ?
it gets harder .
well , what else do we have in a quality of life ?
let &apos;s see .
oh yeah , tasty !
lembas-brot .
and the most amazing ...
more lembas-brot .
fremdländische kitchen , i don &apos;t like it , but this is not malevolent .
there &apos;s nothing to get to dimming you , right , sam ?
just the regenwolken .
it &apos;s kind of familiar with me .
because we &apos;ve been here before .
we go around .
what a grauenhafter smell !
this is where there must be a ekelhaftes marshland .
do you do that ?
yeah , i smell it .
we &apos;re not alone .
the filchers .
they filchers !
the dirty little filchers !
where is he ?
they stole him , my sweetie .
cursed are you ! we hate them !
he &apos;s our , yeah , and we want him !
that &apos;s down . you &apos;ve seen it before .
am i right , gollum ?
let &apos;s go back immediately or i cut the throat .
it burns !
it burns us !
it friert us !
nastier elves have twisted together .
take it off of us !
right now !
it &apos;s hopeless !
every orcs in fulltime is going to hear this bawling !
we bonds him and then let him here .
no , no , that will kill us , killing us !
what else did you not deserve !
maybe he really earned death .
but now i see it , i &apos;m sorry with him .
we &apos;ll be nice to you if you &apos;re nice to us .
take it off of us !
we &apos;re going to promise what they want us to do .
we promise ' .
you can &apos;t make a promise that i can leave on .
we kick it ! we &apos;re going to serve him , the lord of the schatzes !
we &apos;re going to confirm on oath ... on the treasure .

so hang on your word !

and it &apos;s just a tagesmarsch advance .
come on !

i &apos;m not a use country .
we &apos;re more dwarfs spurter .
mordsgefährlich about short distances .

strange is the work here .
something bad gives that creature to these creatures and it makes his will against us .
legolas !
what &apos;s your elbenauge ?
their tracks leads to nord-westen .
the uruks takes the hobbits to isengart !
saruman .
the world is changing .
now , who says to the army of isengart and mordor ?
who claims the power and sarumans and against the alliance of the two towers ?
together , sauron , my commander , we &apos;re going to be dominate about mittelerde .
the old world will burn into the firing of the furnaces .
the forests are falling .
a new order will happen .
we &apos;re going to drive the machinery of war with sword and spear and the iron duke of the orcs .
i want to be armed and armed in two weeks .
but , my lord , it &apos;s too many .
so far , not all of us can be armed . we don &apos;t have the resources .
build a dam , dams the river , heating technology the furnaces day and night .
we &apos;re missing fuel , so many furnaces fuel .
the forest of fangorn is in front of our door .

you take your sister .
you &apos;re going to go faster if you &apos;re just too twin-towered .
daddy failed to ride on gárulf .
he &apos;s too big for him !
don &apos;t listen to me .
you &apos;ve got to beat edoras and alarm .
did you understand what i say ?
yes , mama .
i don &apos;t want to continue .
i don &apos;t want to go from here , mama !
freda , i &apos;m going to get progeny soon .
fast !
bow , child !
rohan , my lord , is in front of the case .
théodred .
he &apos;s looking for the king son !
mordor is going to pay for it .
these orcs are not from mordor .
my lord éomer , over here !
he lives .
théodred .
your son is hard to stricken , sir .
he was invaded by orcs .
if we don &apos;t defend our country , it will be saruman .
this is a lie .
saruman of the white was always our friend and ally , at all hands and since .
gríma .
gríma .
gríma .
orcs stripes are now free through our country , peaceable , with most arbitrary murdering .
orcs with the sign of the white hand .
why are you charged to be more comfortable with most worried ?
don &apos;t you see ?
your uncle is very much dependent on you disaffection and kriegstreiberei .
kriegstreiberei ?
how long is it that saruman bought you ?
what was the as promised price , gríma ?
you have a part of your prey , and you &apos;re all axed ?
too long , you &apos;ve seen my sister .
too long you &apos;ve got your steps .
you see a lot , éomer , éomunds son .
too much .
you &apos;re immediately exile out of the kingdom , and all of your herrschaftsgebieten , and come back to your death .
you have no devolution here .
your instructions don &apos;t mean anything .
now , your were mistaken , this is not a command of me .
he comes from king .
he signed him this morning .
weiteratmen .
that &apos;s the trick . breathe !
breathe !
they run as if the sticks of their gentlemen were behind them .
orcs 1 : we &apos;re just going to go ahead and take a breather .
pokes a fire , go !
merry !
merry !
i think it was a mistake of leaving the meadow landscape , pippin .
what are these kinds of sound ?
these are the trees .
do you remember the old-growth forest on the border to bockland ?
they used to say there was something in the water that makes the trees hochwachsen and even make it alive .
alive ?
trees , whispering , talk to each other and even move .
i &apos;m a starving .
just this madige bread and this for three stinkenden days .
yes !
why don &apos;t we get meat here ?
how about those of you ?
they &apos;re fresh .
they &apos;re not there for food .
what about their legs ?
they don &apos;t need them .
oh , look the delicious !
back , you follow it .
the prisoners go to saruman .
it &apos;s alive and alive .
alive ?
why alive ?
can you play with them ?
they have something in it .
a elbische weapon .
the gentleman needs it for the war .
you think we have the ring .
scht !
if you find out that we don &apos;t have it , we &apos;re dead .
chops them . just a bite !
immediately , meat is on the bill of fare .
pippin !
go on , come on !
just to !
he calls for help !
squeaks !
now nobody will save you .
pippin !
a red sun goes up .
tonight , blood has been shed .
your rider of rohan , what &apos;s new in the mark ?
what &apos;s a  , a human and a dwarf here in the riddermark ?
quick !
call me your name , pferdeherr , then i &apos;ll call you my name .
i would chip off you the head , dwarf if it just ragte a little bit over the ground .
you were going to die before you go to devilry .
i &apos;m a aragorn , arathorns son .
this is gimli , glóins son , and legolas from the waldlandreich .
we are friends rohans and théodens , our own king .
théoden won &apos;t be differentiate from the enemy .
he doesn &apos;t recognize his clan .
saruman intoxicated the spirit of the king and challenges the regime of this country .
my flock consists of those who are true to rohan .
and we were banned for that .
the white magician is cunning .
he appears here and there , called the old man in hoods and coat .
and all over the way , its fink are out of our nets .
we &apos;re not fink .
we &apos;re tracking a group of uruk-hai west over the plane .
they &apos;ve captured two of our friends .
the uruks are annihilated .
we &apos;re all erschlugen at night .
but there were two hobbits !
have you seen two hobbits ?
they &apos;d have been small , just kids in your eyes .
we didn &apos;t let anyone alive .
we put it on a pile , and we burned them .
you &apos;re dead ?
i &apos;m sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
like , these horses like a better skill than their last gentleman .
probably lives .
looking for your friends .
but don &apos;t make you hope .
it &apos;s lost in these land .
we ride !
this is one of their gürteln .
we let them down .
a hobbit was here .
and here &apos;s the other .
they &apos;re crawled .
their hands were confinedness .
the bonds has been cut .
then they &apos;re langgelaufen here .
they were tracked .
the belt !
run ' .
the traces continues from battle . for fangorn-wald .
fangorn ?
what &apos;s the amazing thing to do ?
have we taken down him ?
i believe yes , right ?
i get your mistigen little eingeweide out !
come here !

it &apos;s gone .
merry !

run , merry !
little orcs , burárum !
he &apos;s talking merry .
the tree speaks !
tree ?
i &apos;m not a tree .
i &apos;m a were descended from .
a baumhirte .
a shepherd &apos;s shepherd .
don &apos;t talk to him , merry !
don &apos;t get it out .
baumbart call me some .
and ... whose side are you ?
side ?
i &apos;m on the side of nowhere . because nobody is on my side , little orcs .
no one &apos;s in the forest yet .
we &apos;re not orcs .
we are hobbits !
hobbits ?
i &apos;ve never heard anything about a hobbit .
sounds like ork-teufelei .
they come with fire .
they come with äxten .
gnawingly , pungency , breaching , hacking , ardent !
consumer , interlopers !
they were via them .
you don &apos;t understand .
we are hobbits !
halblinge !
auenlandbewohner !
maybe you &apos;re that , and maybe you &apos;re not .
the white magician will know .
the white wizard ?
saruman .
see !
see !
we &apos;ve run you !
scuds you , hobbitse .
scuds you !
great happiness we &apos;ve found you .
nice hobbit .
oh !
a marshland !
he led us to a bog .
a bog . yes , yes .
come on , bless .
we bring you to safe pfaden through the fog .
come on , hobbits !
come on !
we go fast .
i found it .
yeah .
the way through the bogs .
orcs don &apos;t use it .
orcs don &apos;t know him .
they go around miles and miles around .
come on , quick !
quiet and fast , how shadow we need to be .
i hate this place .
much too quiet here .
not to hear a bird for two days .
no , no birds to eat .
no knusprigen birds !
we need to starve , yes .
we have to starve , my sweetie .
here .
what is it that they eat ?
is it ... taste it , yeah ?
he &apos;s trying to suffocation us !
we can &apos;t eat hobbit-essen .
we need to starve !
but then verhungere .
then we &apos;re going to go ahead .
oh , crueler hobbit !
it doesn &apos;t matter whether we &apos;re hungry .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether we need to die .
unlike the lord .
the lord doesn &apos;t care .
the lord knows it .
yeah .
my treasure .
so he lump sum the ownership of us , he never lets you go again .
don &apos;t collars me .
there &apos;s dead !
dead faces in the water !
everybody &apos;s dead .
all rots .
elves and people and orkse .
tremendous battle . long ago .
the totensümpfe .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s your name .
along here .
don &apos;t follow the lights .
otherwise , hobbits go down to the dead and it leaves little candles .
attention now !
frodo !
gollum ?
don &apos;t follow the lights !
gollum !
mr. frodo !
all right ?
beautiful .
so mentors .
oh , my treasure ...
what did you say ?
now , mr. should sleep .
lord must stay in forces .
who are you ?
we can &apos;t ask .
nothing about it .
gollum !
gollum !
gandalf meant you were one of the flussvolk .
cold is hand , heart and bones . cold , who travels away from home .
he said your life was about a sad story .
he doesn &apos;t see what lies in front of him when golden boy ' and moon light dried up .
you were not so vulnerable at all , right ?
sméagol .
what &apos;s it called me ?
that &apos;s been your name earlier , i &apos;m right ?
a very long time ago .
my name .
sméagol .
black cavalier ! hide !
hide !
come on , frodo !
come on !
fast !
you see us .
look at us !
i thought they were dead !
dead ?
no , you can &apos;t kill . impossible .
ghosts !
ghosts with wings !
they call it .
they call them the treasure .
mr. frodo , no fear !
i &apos;m here .
scuds you , hobbits .
the black gate is very close .
orkblut .
these are strange traces .
the air is so stuffiest here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memories and anger .
the trees , they talk to each other .
gimli !
zügle your ax !
they have feelings , my friend .
it was the elves once ...
they quickness the trees , and they taught that .
sprechende trees !
what could trees talk about before , huh ?
except about the nature of eichhörnchendreck .
there &apos;s something out there .
what do you see ?
the white wizard , he &apos;s approaching .
you cannot let them speak to him , otherwise the magic gets us .
we need to be apace .
you &apos;re tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they ?
they &apos;re durchgekommen here . the past day .
they met someone they didn &apos;t expect .
do you solaces that ?
who are you ?
show you !
that &apos;s impossible .
forgiveness me .
i was given you for saruman .
i &apos;m a saruman .
probably more , saruman , how it should be .
you &apos;re like .
through fire ... and water .
from the deepest dungeon to the top of the summit , i fought against the balrog of morgoth .
until finally , i niederwarf and his containment against the side of the mountain .
then surrounded me , and i were mistaken around without thoughts and sense of time .
and over me , the stars moved over and every day was as long as a age on earth .
but it wasn &apos;t the end .
because life budged into me .
i got sent back to my job .
gandalf .
gandalf ?
yeah ...
that &apos;s how you used to call me .
gandalf , the gray one .
that was my name .
gandalf !
i &apos;m a gandalf , the white one .
and i went back to you at the base of the tides .
a lap of your journey is over , now the next one .
war has come over rohan .
we need to go to edoras , so we can .
after edoras ?
this is not a small distance .
we didn &apos;t hear good about rohan .
it &apos;s bad about king .
yes , and it &apos;s not going to be easy to recure .
just say we &apos;ve gone all the way for free ?
should we leave the poor hobbits around here in this grässlichen , dark , dumpfigen , baumverseuchten ...
i mean , wonderful , wonderful forest ?
it was more than pure coincidence that led merry and pippin to fangorn .
many years ago , there &apos;s a big power here .
this is from merry and pippin , like the fall of little rocks that are in the mountains in the mountains .
in one point , you don &apos;t have changed , dear friend .
huh ?
you &apos;re still talking to rätseln .
something is happening in the term that hasn &apos;t happened since the altvorderenzeit .
the were descended from will become an awakening .
and notice that they &apos;re strong .
big ?
oh , that &apos;s good .
so , it &apos;s going to stop with the ärgerei .
merry and pippin are in safety .
in fact , they &apos;re a lot more than you &apos;re going to be soon .
this new gandalf is still a gruffer than the old one .
this is one of the mearas , unless my eyes are being fooled by a magic .
schattenfell .
he &apos;s the prince of all rösser and me through many risks a more faithful friend .
eberesche .
erstrahltest once in the bill
the summer wonderfully wonderfully wonderful .
on your main exponent , you hold a red and gold .
so you trugst the supergrass .
that beautiful verse .
is it very far ?
bararum .
not so hastiest .
you may call it a long way .
my home is deep in the forest , near the roots of the mountain .
i promised gandalf that nothing happened you and what i promise .
i think the next one is going to be like you .
it &apos;s a eigenkomposition .
so ...
it dreamed the foliage in the canopy .
life cells , branch and branch .
when shadiest moss is green and cool .
and the west wind invites one .
how do i miss you ?
how do i miss you ?
and say , this country is mine .
oh .
nightcap , little auenländer .
don &apos;t hear a at night sound .
nightcap to morning light .
i have now to do in the forest .
it &apos;s true to call a lot .
many people have to come .
a shadow is on fangorn .
approach all the forests .
the threat of shadow , which is lurks in the east , is now taking shape .
sauron will not tolerate rivals .
from the height of barad-dür , his eye wakes up incessancy .
but it &apos;s not so powerful yet that it &apos;s loftiest .
forever , the doubt of it .
he &apos;s heard rumors .
the legacy is alive .
sauron fear you , aragorn .
he fear what you might be .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to slamming the world quickly .
it &apos;s going to be sarumans to annihilating rohan .
there will be war .
rohan has to defend , and there is our first challenge , because rohan is weak , and it &apos;s just in front of the case .
the king thought is enslaved , a very old trick .
its impact on king théoden is very strong now .
sauron and saruman are now moving the halter .
but as much as they may be , we have an advantage .
the ring remains hidden .
and that we could try to destroy it , and you don &apos;t think of it in your darkest dreams .
and so the weapon of the enemy re-drying gene .
in the hand of a hobbits device , it &apos;s closer to the flames of the mount doom .
we need to trust now .
all of it depends on it quickly , and that his project is secret .
you can &apos;t regret to get away .
he alone has to end up with this task .
he &apos;s not alone .
sam is at him .
oh , actually ?
oh , actually ?
good .
yeah . very good .
the black door of mordor .
oh , stand at us .
my old nuncle would have a lot to say if he could see us now .
the gentleman said , show him the path to mordor .
the good sméagol does . the gentleman said ' .
you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s what i guess was ' .
we never get there .
see !
the gate !
it opens up !
here &apos;s a way down .
sam , no !
my lord !
you don &apos;t have to come with me , sam .
i know mr. frodo .
even our elbenmäntel will not be able to protect us inside .
now !
no !
no , mr. !
you get you !
you get you !
don &apos;t bring it to him .
he wants to have it , the treasure .
it &apos;s always on search for it .
and the honey really wants to go back to him .
but we can &apos;t let him get the honey .
no !
there &apos;s another way !
a geheimeren .
a dark way .
and why did you never talk about it before ?
because the lord didn &apos;t ask anything .
it leads to what &apos;s going on .
you say there &apos;s a way to mordor ?
there &apos;s a path and stairs .
and then a tunnel .
he took us so far , sam .
mr. frodo , no !
but he &apos;s got a oath sworn .
no .
show us the path , sméagol .
good news is always helping .
hello ?
baumbart ?
where is he ?
i had a wonderful dream tonight .
from such a big grain full of pipeweed .
and we have all weggeraucht .
and then you get bad .
what would i spend now for ' face amount face amount ages .
did you hear that ?
there was ' over there .
here &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
and what &apos;s wrong here !
you &apos;ve just said something on baumisch .
no , no .
i just gereckt myself .
you &apos;re bigger .
' who ?
you go !
what ?
as i !
i &apos;ve always been bigger than you .
pippin , it really knows everybody , i &apos;m the big one , and you &apos;re the small one .
i urge you , merry !
how big are you ?
three ft six ?
at an outside estimate .
whereas i &apos;m just three ft seven .
three ft eight !
3 ft eight .
you did something .
merry , you ...
m ... d ...
merry !
no , baumbart said you don &apos;t drink it !
i want what !
he said it could be dangerous !
go ahead , give it off !
merry !
what &apos;s going on here ?
it has my leg !
merry !
no !
help !
henceforth with you !
you shouldn &apos;t be awake .
eat earth .
grave deep .
drinkable water water .
go sleep .
henceforth with you .
come on . the forest is in the awakening .
this is not safe .
the trees have become wild and dangerous .
anger gardens in their hearts .
black is their thoughts .
strong is her hatred .
they &apos;re malignant if they can .
well , there are too few of us were descended from .
too few to be done with them .
if you live that long , why are there just so few of you ?
is there ent-kinder ?
burárum .
enttings has no longer given it for a long number of years .
why not ?
we lost the entfrauen .
i &apos;m sorry .
how are they dying ?
died ?
no !
we lost them .
and now we can &apos;t find them .
you didn &apos;t happen to see entfrauen in the meadow landscape ?
i can &apos;t say that honestly .
you , nonsense ?
what do you see ?
well , i can &apos;t remember .
edoras and the golden hall meduseld .
there &apos;s théoden , king of rohan , whose mind is subverts .
sarumans inlet opening on king théoden is very strong now .
my lord , your son , he &apos;s dead .
my lord ?
uncle ?
don &apos;t you want to get him ?
don &apos;t you want to do anything ?
be careful what you &apos;re saying .
don &apos;t expect you to be here .
he probably has to be different during the night .
as tragic for the king , the only son and heirs .
i know that goodbye is not easy to add .
in particular , there &apos;s your brother down there .
let me , snake !
but you are alone .
who knows what you &apos;re doing of the darkness , in the bitter hours of the night , if your whole existence seems to shrink .
you have the walls of your own gemachs gemachs in a cage like fiercest animals .
so beautiful , so cool ...
like a paler morning in the spring , durchhaucht of winterkälte .
your words are like poison .
in every cemetery , the mood is happy .
ah !
so i &apos;m not allowed to armed you to king théoden let go first , gandalf graurock .
on bidding schlangenzunge .
your staff .
huh ?
oh ...
you don &apos;t want to take an old man , you know ?
my commander , gandalf , the gray one , is arrived .
he &apos;s a forerunner of the suffering .
the politeness in your hall has a little flagged , théoden king .
he &apos;s not welcome .
why would i welcome you to be being called , gandalf ?
this is a very entitled question , mister and commander .
it &apos;s an hour later that this magician enters the agenda .
you should call it láthspell !
bad news is a bad guest .
keeps silent !
behaltet your split tongue behind your teeth .
i didn &apos;t go through fire and death now , and now i have mendaciously words with a einfältigen worm .
his staff !
i have you bid , the magician reduces his staff !
théoden , thengels son ! too long you have a shadow .
i &apos;m not going to go into your place now .
stop me !
i &apos;m going to deliverer you from the magic .
you don &apos;t have power here , gandalf , the gray one .
i &apos;m going to saruman you like poison from a wound .
wait !
when i go , then théoden dies .
you didn &apos;t kill me , you &apos;re not going to kill him .
rohan is mine .
soft !
i know your face .
éowyn .
éowyn .
gandalf ?
now breathe the fresh air , my friend .
dark , my dreams were lately .
your fingers would better remind your old strength if you put your sword .
i always serve you , my lord !
your schöpfende art of healing would almost have led me to crawl into all four of the four , like an animal !
don &apos;t send me from your side .
no , my lord !
let him go .
enough blood has already been shed .
i go out of my way !
hallows , théoden , king !
where is théodred ?
where is my son ?
simbelmynë .
it &apos;s been growing on the hügelgräbern of my ancestors .
now it &apos;s supposed to cover the grave of my son .
that these evil days must be mine .
the boys die and the old sticks .
i still live and see the last days of my house .
your death doesn &apos;t blame her .
no father should wear his child .
he was strong in life .
his soul will find the way to the halls of your fathers .
they were not warning , were armless .
now , wild people are moving through the westfold and burn everything down .
barnstable , schober and tree .
where is mom ?
scht ...
this is just a taste of the word of terror , the saruman heraufbeschwört .
the horror is still wirkungsvoller , because saruman is driven by fear sauron .
riding and he &apos;s offering his forehead .
clucks it away from your wives and children .
you have to fight !
you have 2,000 capable of men who are riding in this moment .
éomer is true to you .
they will go back and fight for their king .
they &apos;re now going to be 300 miles away from here .
éomer can &apos;t help us .
i know what you &apos;re expecting to do , but i don &apos;t want a vermehrtes sorry under my people .
i don &apos;t want to risk an open war .
open war is before you want to risk it or not .
as far as i can remember , théoden , not aragorn , king of rohan .
and what &apos;s the king decision ?
caron caron caron
we &apos;re looking at asylum most clammy .
don &apos;t appreciate you .
just look at the nötigste .
helms most clammy !
they escape the mountains , even though they &apos;re going to stay here and fight .
who will defend them if not your king ?
he &apos;s just doing what he affected for his people .
helms most clammy has been saving it earlier .
from this clough , no way out .
théoden runs into a trap .
he believes to bring his people to security .
but it will end up in a bloodbath .
théoden has a strong will , but i fear it .
i fear the survival of the survival .
he &apos;s going to need you in front of the end , aragorn .
the people of rohan will need you .
your defense has to be brave .
it &apos;s going to hold .
the gray pilgrimage , they used to call me .
now , for 300 people i &apos;ve been on this earth now , and now i have no time .
in luck , my search is not going to be free .
i would like to get my first light to the first light of the fifth day .
sunrise looks at the east .
go .
the stallion licensing is clownish , dominates .
it &apos;s futile .
his name is brego .
he was the horse of my vetters .
brego ?
your name is kinglike .
i heard about the zauberkünsten of the elves , but i wouldn &apos;t have expected it to be a ranger from the north .
you speak like one of your own .
as a child , i lived in bruchtal . for a while .
this is free .
he saw enough of the war .
gandalf , the white !
gandalf , the goop !
he trachtet me to humiliate with his new discoveries ?
it was three that followed the magician .
a  , a dwarf and a human being .
you go to horse .
the person ...
was he from gondor ?
no , from the north .
i mean , one of the dúnedain ranger , it seemed to me .
dressed poorest .
and yet , he wore a strange ring .
two snakes with smaragdenen eyes .
the one devouring , the other coronated with golden flowers .
barahirs ring .
then gandalf graurock , believes inheritance , believed .
the verschollenen king gondors .
he &apos;s a goop .
this is gender defunct .
that &apos;s insignificant .
human beings are be destroyed .
start in edoras .
i &apos;m ready , gamling .
bring me my horse .
this is not going to defeat .
we will go back .
we will go back .
you &apos;re sent to the sword .
the women have learned that those without swords can still die through a sword .
i fear neither death nor pain .
what do you fear , mistress ?
a cage .
to stay behind bars , for habit and high age , and make all the great , big things , big success .
you &apos;re a daughter of kings . a schildmaid rohans .
i don &apos;t think that will be your destiny .
théoden won &apos;t stay in edoras .
it &apos;s vulnerable .
he knows that .
he will expect the city to attack .
they escape helms most clammy , the great stronghold of rohan .
it &apos;s a dangerous way to take them through the mountains .
they &apos;re going to be slow .
they become women and children .
send out your warg-reiter !
hey , soap-dodger ! don &apos;t go too far ahead .
why do you do that ?
what ?
you beschimpfst him .
give him more abominable names .
simple .
because it &apos;s exactly that , mr. frodo .
there &apos;s nothing left in him than lying and act of treason .
he &apos;s got it on the ring .
everything else doesn &apos;t care .
you don &apos;t know how he suffered under the ring . he &apos;s still suffering under him .
i want to help him , sam .
why ?
he has to be able to get back to that .
you can &apos;t save him , mr. frodo .
what do you know about that ?
nothing .
excuse me , sam .
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
i have .
it &apos;s the ring .
you still have eyes for him !
i watched you .
you don &apos;t eat anything .
let alone that you schläfst .
he &apos;s been doing it by you , mr. frodo . fight against it !
i know what i do , sam .
the ring has been committed me .
that &apos;s my job !
mine .
my own !
do you hear about it ?
do you know how you anhörst ?
we want it .
we need it .
we have to have it , the treasure .
they stole us the treasure .

sméagol is free .
look !
look !
look what sméagol finds !
they &apos;re young .
they &apos;re tender .
they &apos;re nice .
yes , they are .
eat it .
eat it !
you &apos;re doing it with your behavior .
rabbits can only be in a kind of food .
what does it do ?
stupid fat substitute hobbit !
they spoil it !
what do you spoil ?
it &apos;s not meat anyway .
what would i give for a few tüften .
what are tüften , my sweetie ?
what are tüften ?
huh ?
kar-tof-feln .

oh , we could .
spoil the nice fish .
give it us , raw and flouncing .
keep nastier bratkartoffeln !
i &apos;m driving it up .
mr. frodo , where are you ?
who are they ?
bad people .
servant of sauron .
you call them mordor .
the dark jagged all armies around .
no longer takes a long time .
he &apos;s ready to be ready .
ready ? what ?
ready for his war .
the last war , which is becomes the whole world with shadows .
we should continue .
come on , sam .
mr. frodo !
there !
olifanten !
no one will believe at home .
sméagol ?
we &apos;ve been arrested for a lot too long .
come on , sam .
no !
wait !
we &apos;re innocent hiker !
there &apos;s no hiker in this country .
just the servant of the dark steepletop .
we &apos;re dedicated to a secret mission .
those who claim to be against the enemy would do well to stop us .
the enemy ?
his conscientiousness was in nothing for you , i mean .
you wonder how he meant and where he came from .
whether he really had a bad heart .
what lies or threats have caused him to the long march from his home .
if he didn &apos;t rather have stayed there . in peace .
the war is making bodies from us all .
tie your hands .
it &apos;s true , many zwergenfrauen , you don &apos;t see .
and they &apos;re also similar to us in the voice and what they &apos;re often holding for male dwarfs .
it &apos;s on the bärten .
and then again , the fallacy came out that there &apos;s no zwergenfrauen , and that dwarfs just came out of erdlöchern ! which , of course , is ridiculous .
all right , good .
just no panic .
that was intent .
that was intent .
it &apos;s long ago that i saw my niece smile .
she was still a child when she was brought home to her father , from orcs .
she watched her mother broke from grief .
and then she was alone and he used her king under a wachsender fear .
it &apos;s darndest for an old man that you should love to love .
gimli .
uh , no , that ...
thank you ...
i did a potting .
it &apos;s not much , but it &apos;s hot .
thank you .
it &apos;s good .
right ?
my uncle tells me something weird .
he said you &apos;re moved to war with thengel , my grandfather .
but he has to be wrong , i think .
the king memory is good .
he was still a little kid .
then you have to be at least 60 .
70 ?
you can &apos;t be 80 .
87. 87. 87.
you &apos;re one of the dúnedain .
a descendant of the númenorer who are blessed with a long life .
it means your gender was in the realm of legend .
few of us are left .
the farther north kingdom was destroyed a long time ago .
sorry .
please , eat .
the light of the abendsterns is not too much .
it belongs to me , i can give it to the who i want .
like my heart .
sleep now .
i sleep .
this is a dream .
then it &apos;s a good dream .
sleep .
you &apos;d say that this day will come .
this is not the end ; it &apos;s the beginning .
you have to go to frodo .
that &apos;s your way .
my path is hidden in front of me .
he &apos;s already stuck on her feet .
eventually you cannot dilatoriness .
arwen ... if you don &apos;t do anything else , familiarity .
where is it ?
the woman who once gave you this ornament ?
our time here is over .
and also arwens time .
let &apos;s move .
let &apos;s go to the ship of the ship .
let your love take your love to the immortal , where it stays forever .
but nothing more than memory .
i &apos;m not going to give you a arwen here .
it &apos;s just here because it has hope .
it &apos;s because of you .
but she belongs to her people .
and so you take a goodbye ?
did you think you could get some signs on the fort table ?
i &apos;m not going to return .
you underestimates your kriegsgeschick .
you &apos;re going to return .
i &apos;m not talking about death in the battlefield .
what do you talk about ?
you have the views of another life , far from of war , mourning , despair .
why do you say that ?
i &apos;m a mortal .
you elbischen .
it was a dream , arwen .
nothing on .
i don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s yours .
it was a gift .
keep it .
my lord ?
they went to the immortal to the immortal , with all that are left by their people .
what is ?
háma ?
i &apos;m not sure .
warge !
a scout !
what have you seen ?
warge !
they make us reach .
all the rider at the top of the box office draw !
so , it lifts me up .
i &apos;m a rider .
forward ! go !
you &apos;ve got to lead people to helms most clammy , quickly .
i can fight !
no !
you have to do that . for me .
follow me !
hüa !
forward !
i mean , move forward .
run to the valley !
so !
now !
sit together !
my ax is waiting for your grotesque face !
it goes to my calculation !
stinkende creature !
aragorn !
aragorn ?
tell me what happened , then i &apos;ll leave you .
he &apos;s dead .
he &apos;s just down there from the cliff .
you lie !
the transportation of injured persons on the horses .
the wolves will come back .
the dead are here .
come on .
finally !
helms most clammy !
we did it .
we &apos;re in safety , mistress !
mom !
éothain !
freda !
where is the rest ?
we couldn &apos;t take it , mistress .
all right , make everything in the caves .
makes room for the king !
power for théoden !
space for the king .
so few .
so few are back .
our people are in security .
we paid for a lot of lives .
mistress .
mr. aragorn ... where is he ?
he &apos;s like .
push all of our troops behind wall !
bolts the gate !
post up !
what happens to those who can &apos;t fight , my commander ?
with women and children ?
bring it into caves .
sarumans arm has got to be long when he thinks to be able to reach here .
helms most clammy has a trouble spot .
his außenwall is made up of solid rock , but there &apos;s a little outlet opening on the bottom , hardly more than a abflussschacht .
how ?
how does fire undermine stone ?
what elixir do you get to get the wall niederzubringen ?
it &apos;s going to be helms most clammy .
even if you durchbräche it , an unimaginable number would be necessary , thousands , to storms .
tens of thousands .
but , my commander , there is no such force .
a new power spreads .
and your victory is close .
tonight , the country becomes blotted with the bleeds rohans .
up to helms most clammy !
don &apos;t leave anyone alive !
forward !
there is no morning for humanity .
see !
the south goes up smoke .
well , it &apos;s always rising from isengart of those days .
it used to be saruman often in my forests .
now it &apos;s got metal and wheels in the sense .
it &apos;s nothing more about growing living .
what is that ?
this is sarumans force .
the war started .
may the affection of the valar protect you .
brego .
arwen .
it &apos;s so far .
the ships sail valinor .
now , before it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;ve met my choice .
he will not return to you .
why are you still sitting here if there &apos;s no hope ?
there &apos;s still hope .
if aragorn survived this war , you &apos;ll still be separated .
and if sauron is defeated and aragorn king , and everything that you &apos;re talking about , it &apos;s got prepossessed , and yet it &apos;s going to experience bitterwort .
whether through the sword or slow decline , one day aragorn .
and no consolation will give you , no consolation , to relieve the pain of its scheidens .
it gets to death . it &apos;s a picture of all the magnificence of menschenkönige in its ungetrübten , before the world broke apart .
but you , my daughter , you &apos;re going to keep on in the dark stages and in doubt like the winter night sky without star .
this is where you &apos;re going to failure to meet a deadline your own existence , confinedness of grief under the schwindenden trees , so long until the world turned through and all of your life years went extinct .
arwen .
there &apos;s nothing for you , just death .
don &apos;t i have your love ?
you have my love , father .
the enemy is growing .
sauron uses saruman as lay figure to annihilating the people .
isengart has shrunk .
now the eye saurons itself on gondor , the last free kingdom of people .
his war against this country is rapidly pull up .
he feels that the ring is close .
the power of ringträgers wanes .
deep in his heart , frodo starts to realize that the challenge is his life .
you know that .
you &apos;ve chosen it .
we &apos;ve all mentioned that .
in the early days , the will erstarkt the will .
by every prize , he &apos;s looking back to the hands of people , those people , who are making it so light .
the young heermeister gondors needs only to spread its hand to take the ring and the world gets be destroyed .
he &apos;s just about to reach his goal .
because sauron is about everything on this earth , even over the end of the world .
the time of elves is over .
are we leaving ourselves ?
let &apos;s put them all down ?
what &apos;s new ?
our scout report that saruman rohan has 89 .
théodens people fled helms most clammy .
but our own limitations should be worried about us .
faramir , orcs are in the advance .
sauron provides an army .
ostlinge and southerner happen the black gate .
how many ?
several thousand .
every day , more .
who are monitored the flow in the north ?
500 man from osgiliath .
will be attacked by the city , we will not keep them .
saruman comes from isengart .
sauron of mordor .
people are going to have to fight on both sides .
gondor is weak .
sauron will soon attack us .
and it becomes a hard flick .
he now knows that we don &apos;t have the power to kill him .
my men argue you &apos;re ork-spitzel .
fink ?
that should be a joke .
now , if you &apos;re not a fink , who are you ?
talk !
we are hobbits from the meadow landscape .
frodo baggins is my name . and this is samweis gamdschie .
your bodyguard ?
his gardens .
and where is your sneakingly friend ?
this verwahrloste creature ?
you want to say ugly .
we &apos;re on the road alone .
with seven companions , we broke on bruchtal .
we lost one in moria . we were four hobbits . it was a dwarf .
and a  and two people .
aragorn , arathorns son and boromir from gondor .
are you a friend of mine ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got my part .
then you get to know that he &apos;s dead .
dead ?
why ?
when ?
as one of his companions , i hoped that she told me .
if something happened to boromir , you have to tell us .
his horn had washed up to the river river , about six days ago .
it was divided in two parts .
but more than that , it tells me my heart .
he was my brother .
boromir !
boromir !
this city once was the jewel of our kingdom .
a hoards of light , beauty and music .
and this is what it should be like again .
let &apos;s say the streitkräften mordors .
never again , the country of my people drops in the enemy !
the city osgiliath has been claimed back ! for gondor !
- ! for gondor !
- ! for gondor !
talked good .
nice and short .
that &apos;s the way to drink more time .
the drums abroach !
the men here are thirstiest !
leaflet the day today , little brother .
today life is beautiful .
what ?
he &apos;s here .
not a moment of peace , he can deign us .
where is he ? where is he ? where is gondors best ?
where is my first-begotten ?
dad !
they say , almost in the going it alone , you would have defeated the enemy .
overdo them .
faramir did the same thing for victory .
if faramir had done his part , the city would be .
didn &apos;t you have to defend them ?
i survived it , but we were too few .
so , too few ?
you got the enemy to do the city .
how many times don &apos;t you appear to me in a good light .
that &apos;s not my intention .
he tries to be to be to will , and never have you left for him .
he loves you , father !
trouble me not with faramir . i know about his strengths , and it &apos;s not many .
we have dringlicheres to talk .
elrond of bruchtal has a poll .
he doesn &apos;t want to tell why , but i can think of the occasion .
it &apos;s the bruit , you found the gun of the enemy .
it &apos;s a ring .
isildurs curse .
he &apos;s gone into the hands of the elves .
they all want to be taking possession of .
people , dwarfs , magician .
we can &apos;t let that happen .
this thing has to go to gondor !
- ...
it &apos;s dangerous , i know .
always the ring is going to try to addling the hearts of shallow people .
but you , you &apos;re strong .
and our distress is big .
it &apos;s our blood that &apos;s been shed ; our people that suffers death .
sauron is still going to happen .
it leaves masses of troops .
he will return .
and if that happens , we &apos;re much too powerless to stop it .
you have to go !
bring me this powerful gift .
no .
my place is here , with my people .
not in bruchtal !
do you mind your father ?
it &apos;s necessary to ride for bruchtal .
spiffiest me .
you ?
ah , i understand .
now faramir , the heermeister gondors , can show what it &apos;s worth .
rather than .
this assignment , i just trust your brother .
one who doesn &apos;t get me down .
leaflet the day today , little brother .
heermeister faramir !
we found the third one .
you have to come with me .
immediately .

just come in and look at the verbotenen pond , the death penalty .
they expect my command .
should i be shooting ?
cooling wanted wanted were of use , we suhlen suhlen
so saftig-süß saftig-süß .
and then there &apos;s a fish coming on the table .
so saftig-süß saftig-süß .
wait !
i &apos;m tied to this creature .
and it &apos;s to me .
it leads us .
please , let me down to him .
sméagol .
the lord is here .

sméagol .
why is sméagol crying ?
cruel people are going to hurt us .
lord browned us .
of course he did .
i told you that it &apos;s deceitful .
i told you that he &apos;s wrong .
lord is our friend .
our friend !
lord tells us .
no !
no matter .
let &apos;s stay alone !
dirty little hobbitse .
they stole him !
no .
no !
what have you stolen ?
my treasure !
we have to disappear here .
go .
go , go !
you can do that .
use the ring , mr. frodo .
just this time !
sit down .
become invisible .
i can &apos;t .
you were right , sam .
you wanted to warn me , but ...
i &apos;m sorry .
the ring of me arrest me , sam .
when i attach him , he finds me .
he sees it .
but , mr. frodo ...
so , this is the solution to all of the puzzles .
here in the wild , i have two halblinge , and a flock of people under my command .
and the ring of power is totally close to me .
now faramir , the heermeister gondors , can show what it &apos;s worth .
no !
stop !
let him quiet .
don &apos;t you find that ?
he must destroy him !
and we did . we go to mordor .
the feurigen mountain !
osgiliath is under bombardment .
they call them amplification .
please !
he &apos;s carrying such a load .
you must help him , please .
heermeister ?
we break up .
the ring will go to gondor .
he &apos;s alive !
where is he ?
out of the way !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m teaching .
you &apos;re the foxiest , the gerissenste , the really most foolhardy who ever met me .
be blessed !
gimli , where is the king ?
you come late .
you look terrible .
heerscharen , do you tell ?
fulltime is cleared .
how many ?
10,000 head strong , at least .
10,000 ?
it &apos;s an army , bred for one purpose .
annihilating the world of people .
if you break the night , you &apos;re here .
let them come .
it &apos;s every man and every beefier boy child , which is weapons-grade , art the night .
we can make the causeway and the tor of above .
no army ever has the klammwall broken or a foot in the hornburg .
this is not a band hirnloser .
these are uruk-hai .
their armaments are thick and their shields are wide .
i gefochten a lot of wars , dominates dwarf .
i don &apos;t know to defend my own stronghold .
they &apos;re going to break to the stronghold like water on rock .
sarumans hordes are being rape and pillage , but we &apos;ve seen that before .
crops can be built new , building houses .
within those walls we will survive .
they don &apos;t want to destroy rohans fields or villages .
they want to eradicate rohans people until the last child .
tell me what to do .
you see my men !
your combative spirit is almost defunct .
if this is our end , then i want to make it a end of what everybody remembers !
sent cavalier , sir !
you need to pay attention to support .
and who will come ?
elves ?
dwarfs ?
we are glückloser with our friends than they are .
our old confederacies are history .
gondor is going to help .
gondor ?
where was gondor when the westfold fell ?
where was gondor , when our enemies jumped the circle around us ?
where was gradian ?
no , my lord aragorn , we &apos;re alone .
bring the women and children into caves .
we need more time to standzuhalten a siege .
théoden : we don &apos;t have time .
we &apos;re in the war .
hold the door !
we &apos;ve been were descended from for a long time here , not to take people &apos;s wars and zauberern .
but now something happens , which has not happened since an age .
entthing .
what should that be ?
a gathering .
a gathering of what ?
birch oil .
oak paneling .
chestnut oil .
ash grove .
good .
good .
good .
many have come .
now we need to decide whether to pull the were descended from into war .
hurry you !
keep on , people !
scuds you !
we post the second series along the river .
that &apos;s the way the bogenschützen is supporting above the obsegating .
aragorn , you have to rest .
you &apos;re not halblebendig .
my lord , aragorn !
i organized women to join the caves .
a more respectable task .
to look at the kids , to be concerned for food and beds of men ?
that &apos;s all other than glorious !
my mistress , it will soon be necessary without fame .
so , who will your people look at the last defense ?
let me stand on your side .
it &apos;s not in my power to say that .
you don &apos;t know the other one .
yet , they &apos;re fighting next to you because they don &apos;t want to be separate from you .
just because they love you .
i &apos;m sorry .
farmers , farriery , stallburschen .
these are not soldiers .
most of them have seen too much in winter .
or too few .
look at you !
they fear .
i see it in your eyes .
and it &apos;s about 300 .
against 10,000 !
there &apos;s more hope for you , if you &apos;re defending here , instead of edoras .
aragorn .
you can &apos;t win that fight .
you &apos;re all going to die !
then i &apos;m going to die as one of them !
leave him , boy .
let &apos;s give it .
every villagers who can run a sword was sent to the armory .
my commander ?
who am i , gamling ?
you &apos;re our king , bless .
and are you familiar with your king ?
your men , lord , follow you at jedwedem end .
to jedwedem end .
where are cavalier and ross ?
and the horn , which is widely hallende ?
long , how rain in the forest passed .
and wind in the branches .
in the shadow behind the mountains , the days in the west .
how could it come so far ?
huh ?
it &apos;s been going on for hours now .
you &apos;ve got to have something now .
decided ?
no .
we &apos;re just finished crafts .
but now it &apos;s already in the middle of the night .
you can &apos;t leave your time forever .

now we don &apos;t have time anymore .
go hurry .
give me your sword .

they say it &apos;s hopeless .
this is a good sword .
haleth , hámas son . hope is always there .
we always trusted you .
you &apos;ve never met us .
forgiveness me .
i couldn &apos;t have any doubt .
there &apos;s nothing too surprising , legolas .
if we had time , i would change this thing .

i teach lore from bruchtal .
once there was a alliance between elves and people .
a long time ago , and we died side .
this is alliance now .
you &apos;re truly welcome .
moving back to the battle with people , prepossessed us .
you could actually choose a better place .
well , boy , whatever you &apos;re lucky , may outlive the night .
your friends are with you , aragorn .
you also like outlasting the night .
doesn &apos;t show any commiseration , because you &apos;re not going to know anybody .
what happens out there ?
well , i could describe it to you .
or should i get a box ?

we just agreed .
yes ?
i said , &quot; you know , i said , &quot; you &apos;re not orcs . &quot;

but what about saruman ?

not too hastiest , my lord meriadoc .
hastiest ?
our friends are out there !
you need our help !
you can &apos;t win that war alone .

but your role in this story is over .

maybe baumbart is right .
we &apos;re not sitting here , merry .
that &apos;s too big for us .
what can we do about it ?
we have the meadow landscape .
we should go home .
the fire isengarts will spread and the forests of buckelstadt and bockland are burning .
and ...
everything that once was green and good in this world is going to be delict .
there &apos;s no longer going to be there .

stop !
stop !
twirled !
- .
get us south .
south ?
but then you get over to isengart .
yeah .
exactly .
in the south , we can slip by by noteless .
the closer we are the danger , the less it can happen to us .
that &apos;s the last thing he does .
mw : well , it doesn &apos;t sound very obvious to me .
on the other hand , you &apos;re very small .
maybe you &apos;re right .
yes , so to south .
hold , little auenländer .
south i always like to go .
somehow you feel that you go downhill .
are you crazy ?
they get us there .
don &apos;t .
this time not .
see !
osgiliath burns .
mordor has come .
the ring will not save gondor .
he only has the power to destroy .
please go .
quick !
faramir !
you have to let me go .
mmh , a few feldmäuschen that climb sometimes up to me and tickle me .
on the allerwohlsten , you feel when you ...
many of these trees were my friends .
creatures that i knew of nut and acorn .
i &apos;m sorry , baumbart .
they had a voice .
saruman !
a magician had to have more minds !
there &apos;s no curse on elbisch , entisch or in the languages of people for such a treacherousness .
see !
the trees !
they move .
where do you want to go ?
you have something with the orcs .
my job tonight is isengart , with rock and stone .
yeah .
hrumm , hrumm , comes , my friends .
the were descended from are moving into war .
it &apos;s probably the path of our doom and gloom scenario .
the last march of were descended from .
faramir , the orcs have taken the east bank .
they &apos;re far too abundant .
we &apos;re overwhelmed with the night .
mr. frodo ?
he calls him , sam !
his eye quickly captured me .
hang on , mr. frodo .
you can do that .
bring her to my father .
he says faramir sends a powerful gift .
a weapon that &apos;s going to turn our skill into this war .
do you know what happened to boromir ?
why your brother died ?
he had a oath sworn to protect frodo , and then he tried to boil his ring down .
he wanted to kill him !
because of the ring your brother was maddest !
give eight !
mr. frodo ?
you &apos;re here !
they &apos;ve come .
nazgûl !
there it is .
don &apos;t leave you from the spot .
covering up .
the stronghold is taken .
it &apos;s over .
her sagtet , the stronghold would never fall , as long as your people verteidigten them .
they &apos;re still defending them .
they made their lives .
they break through !
they &apos;re off the gate !
is there no other way for women and children out of the caves ?
is there no other way ?
there &apos;s a path .
it goes to the mountains .
but far they don &apos;t come .
the uruk-hai are too abundant .
all women and children are supposed to go on the mountain path .
opacity the entrance !
so much death .
what can the person do against such tollkühnen hatred ?
riding out with me .
riding out and fight !
for death and honor !
for rohan !
for your people !
the sun goes up .
i would like to get my first light to the first light of the fifth day .
sunrise looks at the east .
yeah .
yeah .
the horn helmet hammerhands is supposed to be resound in the most clammy . a allerletztes time .
yes !
this may be the hour because we &apos;re going together .
grimme award did erwachet !

what do you intend ?
where do you want to go ?
i &apos;m a ' .
i , your sam .
don &apos;t you mind your sam ?
i don &apos;t tub that , sam .
i know .
that &apos;s all wrong .
in fact , we shouldn &apos;t be here , in this place .
but we are here .
this is like in the big stories , mr. frodo .
those who were really important .
full of darkness , they were .
sometimes you didn &apos;t want to know the end , because , how could a story look good ?
how could the world be again as if so much of it happened ?
victory !
we have prevailed !
even the darkness has to have soft .
a new day will come .
and if the sun appears , it will seem brighter .
these were the stories that stay in mind that were significant .
even if you were too small to understand it .
but i think mr. frodo , i understand now .
i know now .
people in these stories have always been able to reverse the opportunity , just didn &apos;t do it .
they went on because they believed anything .
what should we believe , sam ?
there &apos;s something good in this world , mr. frodo .
and it &apos;s worth fighting .
i think now we understand each other , frodo baggins .
you know the laws of your country , the laws of your father .
if you run it , your life is forfeits .
then it &apos;s forfeits .
let them go free !
not in the woods .
hold away from the trees .
i count exactly .
42. -- 42 ?
oh , not so bad for a spitzohriges elbenprinzlein .
i gave a seat to the number of 43. .
43. 43. .
it was dead .
he has shrugged .
he has shrugged , because i pushed him my ax between his nervenstränge !
it doesn &apos;t look very happy , what ?
all right , merry .
still , you &apos;ve got a lovely view of this up there .
oh yeah .
a a-one geführtes house .
the butler should be great .
what do you do ?
nothing .
everything is the way it should be . nothing .
not quite .
i have a ravenous hunger .
that &apos;s where we have to be lucky if we want to find some scran .
and there &apos;s ' , just dead rats and schimmeliges bread .
sarumans pantry !
i don &apos;t condolement my eyes !
that &apos;s not true .
yeah , it &apos;s !
langgrundblatt !
finetune pipeweed in southern quarter .
that fits exactly .
a barrel for each of us !
wait !
should we be baumbart what ?
no .
no .
dead plants and all that .
i don &apos;t think he would have to understand it .
he could be a more remote relative .
oh , i understand now .
not so hastiest .
exactly .
barrumm !
this is the old channel .
it goes underneath the river to the outskirts of paris .
the forest will give you protection behind it .
heermeister faramir , you &apos;ve shown what you are worth , ok .
the at an outside estimate .
the meadow landscape must be really peachiest , mr. gamdschie , where gardens are high in honor .
what kind of path do you get when you hit the forest ?
gollum says there was a path near minas morgul , which goes up into the mountains .
cirith ungol ?
isn &apos;t that his name ?
no . no .
yeah !
frodo -- it &apos;s called a dark affright in the pässen above minas morgul .
you cannot go to this path !
there &apos;s no other way .
the gentleman told us it has to be mordor , so we have to try it .
i have to .
go , frodo .
the good wishes of all people .
thank you .
may cruel death befall you , you should be sorry .
come on , don &apos;t slowpoke .
mr. frodo didn &apos;t want the ranger to hurt you .
you know , right ?
he wanted to save you , do you understand ?
saving me ?
so not resentful .
pardon and forget ?
no , no , no , not resentful .
gollum . gollum .
nice gentleman .
nice hobbits .
very bad from you .
really cute , gollum .
saurons anger is going to be terrible , its payback .
the battle of helms most clammy is over .
the battle of mittelerde has only begun .
our hope lies with two little hobbits , somewhere in the wild .
i &apos;d like to know if we ever have in songs or in stories .
what ?
i wonder if people ever say , let &apos;s hear about frodo and the ring .
i say , yes !
this is one of my favorites .
frodo was very bravest , i &apos;m right , dad ?
yeah , my boy .
from all the most famous ones .
and that tells a lot .
but one of the hauptfiguren you left out .
samweis , the beherzten .
tell us more about sam .
frodo would not have come far .
oh , mr. frodo , you &apos;re funny about me .
i was serious .
i &apos;m also serious .
samweis , the more encouraged .
sméagol ?
we &apos;re not waiting for you !
come on .
lord .
lord is looking at us .
lord won &apos;t hurt us .

poor , poor , sméagol .
lord cheated us !
ugly !

we will flip his dirty little neck !
kill him !

don &apos;t kill both .
and then we take the treasure , and we will be the gentleman .
but the fats hobbit , it knows .
eyes are always alive .
and then we throw them out .

yeah , yes , yeah !

yes !
no , no !
is too dangerous , is too dangerous .
where is he ?
where is he ?
hey , gollum !
where are you ?
sméagol ?
we could let them do it .
yes , she could do it .
yeah , my sweetie , she could .
and we take it when they &apos;re dead !
once they &apos;re dead .
now , hobbits !
go long away .
sméagol shows you the path .
follow me .
the lord of the rings .
sméagol !
i have one !
i have a fish , sméagol !
go up , get it up !
déagol !

we need to go !
we need to break instantly .

that &apos;s still enough .
what ?
for home .
come on , hobbitse !
close now .
close to mordor .

you &apos;re chasing about you through the area , and now you &apos;ll find schmausend and fuming ! your boy nichtsnutze !
we &apos;re sitting in the field of triumphal processions , and we enjoy some wohlverdienter adoptabilities .
the pökelfleisch is exquisitely good !
pökelfleisch ?
hobbits ! we subordinate to the command ! he &apos;s the new stewards of isengart .
young master gandalf !
i &apos;m happy about yours .
wood and water , stick and stone can be mastery .
but here it is being done with a magician , locked in its tower .
and there needs to be saruman , guarded , baumbart .
let &apos;s turn it down to the head , finally .
no !
his power is dried up .
the dirt is sarumans .
trees are going to come back to live here .
young trees .
wild trees .
in my borke !
peregrin tuk !
i &apos;ll take that , my boy .
go !
today we honor those who gave their blood to defend this country .
hallows the cozy dead !
hallows !
i &apos;m looking forward to you .
he &apos;s a ruhmreicher man .
you &apos;re both ruhmreiche men .
not théoden from rohan has led our people to victory .
don &apos;t listen to me .
you &apos;re young .
and today &apos;s day is true .

behaltet stand and alexander matrix , clotures the edlen !
because , the real decoration , i tell you this .
is the green dragon hops museum !
thank you .
no news from frodo ?

too dangerous .
too dangerous .
filchers !
they stole him .

not addling it now .
but you know .
they greet us !
what does that mean , my honey , dear ?
is it about nerves ?

sméagol hates nastier hobbitse .

sméagol did it already .
he can do it again .
he &apos;s our !

we have to retrieval the treasure !
patience !
patience , my rather .
we need to get them first .
we lead them to the gewundenen staircase .
yes , the staircase .
and then ?
up , up , the staircase up , until we come to the tunnel .
and when they get inside , they don &apos;t come out again .
it &apos;s always hungry .
it always needs food .

it &apos;s just getting dirty orkse .
and it &apos;s not delicious , what , honey ?
no .
not delicious at all , my rather .

hobbitfleisch .
and if you wegwirft the bones and the left , you find it .
and then he belongs to me !

i heard it from his own mouth .
he wants to kill us ! never !
sméagol wouldn &apos;t have any fly to do .
the lousier , fats hobbit can &apos;t suffer sméagol , so he invents a secret .
you elende little girl !
i grab your skull .
sam !
you &apos;re the liars !
if you verjagst it , we &apos;re lost !
i don &apos;t care .
i can &apos;t wait for him to kill us , mr. frodo !
i can &apos;t sending away it !
you don &apos;t know what ?
he &apos;s a baddie !
we can &apos;t do that alone , sam .
not without a leader .
i need you on my side .
i &apos;m on your side , mr. frodo .
i know , sam .
i know .
familiarity me .
come on , sméagol .
the stars are cloaks .
something happens in the east .
a schlaflose cattiness .
the enemy of the enemy is approaching .
what are you doing ?
pippin !
pippin !
pippin !
are you mad ?
i just want to look at it .
a allerletztes time .
put it back .
pippin !
no !
pippin !
he &apos;s here .
i see you !
pippin !
help !
gandalf !
help him !
pippin !
närrischer tuk !
look at me !
gandalf . forgiveness me .
look at me !
what did you see ?
a tree ...
a white tree in a steinernen farm .
he was dead .
the city burned .
minas tirith .
did you see that ?
i have ...
i saw it .
i could hear his voice in my head .
what did you say to him ?
talk !
he asked my name .
i didn &apos;t respond .
he has hurt me .
what did you tell him about frodo and the ring ?
it wasn &apos;t a lie in pippins eyes .
a fool , but a honest goop remains .
he has nothing about frodo and the ring .
we &apos;ve had strange luck .
pippin could get an insight in our enemy plans .
sauron does an attack on the city of minas tirith .
his enemy at helms most clammy has shown one thing .
that elendils legacy is stepped forward and people aren &apos;t so weak .
they have courage , and perhaps force enough to challenge him .
sauron fear that .
the people mittelerdes together , they won &apos;t risk .
in fact , he makes minas tirith the ground as the return of a king on the throne of people .
if the beacon fire gondors are kindled , it has to be rohan readiness for war .
tell me why should we contaminate those help that have failed us ?
what are we attacking ?
i &apos;m going to go .
no ! you have to be warning !
you will .
you have to take a different way to minas tirith .
follow the river and stick for the black ships .
one must be aware .
well , something is underway that can &apos;t be done .
i bow for minas tirith , but not alone .
from all the naseweisen hobbits , peregrin tuk , you &apos;re the worst .
faster !
where do we go ?
why have you looked ?
why would you always have to look at everything ?
i don &apos;t know .
i couldn &apos;t be different .
you can never .
i &apos;m sorry , yes ?
i don &apos;t do ' .
don &apos;t you even have a clue ?
the enemy believes you have the ring .
he will look for you , nonsense .
you have to remove yourself here .
but you come with me ?
merry ?
come on now !
how far is minas tirith ?
a dreitagesritt , like the nazgûl flies .
let us hope that we don &apos;t have any of those of us .
here .
a little bit on the road .
the rest of the langgrundblatt !
i know you don &apos;t have any more .
you rauchst too much , nonsense .
but we &apos;re going to see ourselves soon ?
right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
merry !
run , schattenfell . show us what a coin means !
merry !
merry !
led it to sicherstem .
in the gray hemisphere , a ship is preliminary practice .
it &apos;s waiting to carry you across the sea , the last trip of arwen undómiels .
there is nothing for you . only death .
woman arwen ! we &apos;re not allowed to stay .
mistress !
tell me what you &apos;ve seen .
arwen . you have the gift of the foreknowledge .
what did you see ?
i saw in your future glanced and death .
there &apos;s life there .
you &apos;ve seen a child there .
you &apos;ve seen my son !
this is the future of wanes .
but it &apos;s not lost .
there is nothing .
some things are certain .
if i leave him now , i &apos;m going to forever regret .
it &apos;s time .
out of ashes , the fire is hit , and shadow comes out of light .
hallows sword chisel tine sword
and king who lost the crown .
forging the sword .
your hands are cool .
the breath of life of the eldar leaves you .
this was my decision .
you know , whether you want it or not , there &apos;s no more ship that can take away me .
we &apos;ve just entered the kingdom .
minas tirith .
the city of kings .
out of the way !
that &apos;s the tree .
gandalf !
gandalf ! yes , the white tree gondors .
the tree of the king .
but mr. denethor is not the king .
he &apos;s just truchsess , custodian of the throne room .
now , listen to me .
mr. denethor is boromirs &apos;s father .
he was deliver the message of his son &apos;s death .
and you don &apos;t mention frodo nor the ring .
and you don &apos;t say anything about aragorn .
and the best thing you &apos;re doing is not just the mouth , peregrin tuk .
hallows , denethor , ecthelions son , mister and truchsess of gondor .
i come with a message in this dark hour and with advice .
maybe it comes lhr to explain that .
maybe it comes lhr to explain why my son is dead .
boromir dropped to save us , my cousin and me .
as he suffers against enemies .
pippin !
what i can do to service , let me offer you to this guilt .
stand up .
my lord , the time , boromir to bemoan , will give it , but it &apos;s not now .
war pulls up .
the enemy is in front of you .
as a result , lhr are lhr with the defense of this city .
where are gondors troops ?
you have friends .
you &apos;re not alone in that fight .
apprised théoden of rohan .
ignited the beacon fire !
you think it &apos;s wise .
but you don &apos;t have wisdom in all your ingenuity .
do you want the eyes of the white steepletop to be blind ?
i &apos;ve seen more than you know .
you want to use me as a sign for mordor .
and with the right you trachtest to deny me .
i know who &apos;s riding with théoden proceed .
oh yeah .
i heard about this aragorn , arathorns son .
i &apos;m going to tell you , you know , a ranger from the north of the north , i don &apos;t think of it as the last one of a zerlumpten house , has been bereaved for a long time .
you &apos;re not empowered to refuse the king , truchsess !
the rule of gondor is my ! and no other !
come on !
that &apos;s probably a zeremonielle post .
they hardly expect me to fight .
or yet ?
you &apos;re now in the service of truchsess .
you &apos;re going to do what you &apos;re doing .
peregrin tuk , custodian of the veste .
it &apos;s so quiet .
this is the deep luftholen luftholen .
i don &apos;t want to stand in any battle , but waiting for one that you can &apos;t avoid , is even worse .
is there even hope , gandalf ? for frodo and sam ?
it never had a lot of hope .
just a fool could hope .
our enemy is ready .
all its forces are gathered up .
not just orcs , but also people .
heerscharen from the south .
merc from shore , they &apos;re all going to be able to make a call .
that will be the end of the way we know it .
this is the blow of a hammer blow of a hammer held office .
if the river is taking off , when the crew falls in osgiliath , this city is no longer defending .
but we have the white wizard .
that must be good for anything .
gandalf ?
it hasn &apos;t sauron his country tödlichsten butler , who is going to lead the mordors forces in war .
those of you who mean , no living man can kill him .
the hexenkönig of angmar .
you &apos;ve met him once .
he &apos;s got frodo on the wetterspitze .
he &apos;s the prince of the nazgûl . the top of the nine .
minas morgul is his seat .
the dead city .
very bad place .
full of enemies .
fast .
fast !
you see us otherwise !
come on !
see ! we found it .
the path to mordor .
the secret staircase .
climbing !
no ! mr. frodo !
not long .
what does it do ?
no ! you call me . no !
hide ! hide !
i can feel his blade .
this is the hour of the great battle of our time .
come on , hobbits .
we need to climb !
the checkerboard is set .
the characters are in motion .
peregrin tuk , my boy , there &apos;s something to do .
once again , a auenländer can provide its high value .
you can &apos;t let me down .
quiet .
the river !
quick !
further , further .
faster !
crossed swords mark .
amon dîn .
the beacon fire !
the beacon fire of amon dîn is kindled !
hope gleams .
the beacon fire of minas tirith !
burning the beacon fire !
gondor beseeched for help !
and rohan will afford .
let &apos;s go to the heerschau !
gathered the army in dunharg .
so many men , as you can find .
you have two days .
in third , we ride to gondor and to war !
gamling !
scuds through the riddermark .
calls all the tauglichen men to dunharg .
do you ride with us ?
just to feldlager .
it &apos;s practice that the women at court etiquette are leaving men .
the men found their heermeister .
they will follow you in the battle , even in death .
you &apos;ve given us hope .
so before the walls of minas tirith , the fate of our age is supposed to be .
here &apos;s the hour .
cavalier of rohan , oaths , have their sworn .
now , all of you .
for mr. and country !
faramir !
we can &apos;t brave them .
the city is lost .
give up positions .
we go to minas tirith .
nazgûl .
give up the post !
retreat !
retreat to minas tirith !
retreat !
retreat !
the era of people is over .
the time of orcs has come .
the white rider !
pull !
mithrandir !
they have our defense broken .
they &apos;ve taken the bridge and the west bank .
ork-verbände are on the river .
how mr. denethor augured it !
long , he saw this decline ahead .
and yet he was frowning !
faramir ?
this is not the first halflin halfling to check your way .
no .
you saw frodo and sam ?
where ? when ?
in lthilien .
no two days ago .
gandalf , they take the road into the morgul-tal .
and then the passport of cirith ungol .
what does that mean ?
what have you ?
faramir , tell me everything .
attention , bless .
here you go very deep .
very dangerous is the staircase .
come on , bless .
come to sméagol .
mr. frodo !
go away !
don &apos;t stirrer him .
why does he hate poor sméagol ?
what did he ever do ?
mr. ?
the gentleman has severe burden .
sméagol knows .
heavy , heavy burden .
the fats can &apos;t know ' .
sméagol fits the lord .
he wants him .
he needs him !
sméagol is in his eyes .
very soon , he will ask you afterwards .
just wait .
the fats will take him away .
entsendet all the troops .
let &apos;s not end the storm until the city is conquered .
butchers everybody down !
what about the magician ?
i &apos;m going to crunching him .
where are théodens cavalier ?
code of conduct army ?
mithrandir ?
courage is the best defense to have now .
here i am vowing and service for gondor in peace or war , in life or die .
from ... this hour from now on , until my lord freigibt me or death .
and i &apos;m not going to forget about it nor lapsing , to reciprocating , which is given .
lehnstreue with love .
boldness with honor .
perjury with punishment .
we should have the outer defensive zone -- not so carelessness , which held your brother so long .
what do you want me to do ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the river in pelennor .
osgiliath must be reconquered .
osgiliath became run down .
a lot has to be dreamed of war .
is there a heerführer that has the courage to fulfill the wish of his lord ?
you wünschst , our places were interchanges . that i was dead and boromir alive .
yeah , i wish that !
because you &apos;re boromirs bereaved , i want to do what i &apos;m going to do instead of .
if i went back , i think better from me , father .
it depends on the way you return .
what are you doing ?

well , yeah .
well enough for my own people at least .
but we don &apos;t have songs for large halls and bad times .

home faintness , re-drying the world .
with a lot of pfaden , it &apos;s there .
and clucks through shadow , wore and night .
by finally , diamond star came up .
cloud , crepuscle , nebeldunst .
without affection , without ...
affection .
march !

for the king !
my lord !

grimbold , how many ?
about 500 men from westfold .
we have 300 more from the fenmark , théoden king .
where are the rider from the schneeborn ?
it &apos;s not a arrived , sir .
6,000 spears .
less than half as much as i erhoffte .
6,000 will not be enough to break the positions .
it will get more .
with every lost hour of gondors defeat .
we wait until the tomorrow gray shades , we have to ride .
the horses are indefatigable and the men quietness .
the shade of the mountain worries them .
this road there , where does it go ?
this is the road to dimholt , to the gate under the mountain .
no one who hinbegibt there comes back .
this mountain is evil .
aragorn !
let &apos;s look for what to eat .
there .
a true scarcer rohans !
i &apos;m ready !
condones .
in particular , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not even sharp .
that &apos;s not good .
many orcs are not killing lhr with blunter blade .
come on !
to blacksmith shop !
go !
you shouldn &apos;t encourage him .
you shouldn &apos;t doubt him .
i don &apos;t doubter on his heart , just on reach of his arm .
why would you leave merry ?
he &apos;s also got a lot of reason to ride into the battle of how you do .
why can &apos;t he fight for those fighting he loves ?
and so i choose a sterbliches life .
i would have seen him last time .
mr. ?
king théoden would expect you , lord .
i get back .
my lord elrond .
i &apos;m going to show you one that i love .
arwen is dying .
for a long time , it becomes the evil , which is now from mordor heraufzieht , not survival .
the light bathed in light faintness .
it &apos;s like saurons power , so it wanes its power .
arwens life is tied to the fate of ringes .
the shadow is about us , aragorn .
the end has come .
it &apos;s not going to end our end , it &apos;s being .
you go to war , but not in the victory .
saurons forces march to minas tirith , you know .
but he &apos;s going to send a armament that &apos;s going to be made by the river .
a fleet fleet sailcloth sailcloth from the south .
in two days they are in the city .
you have a superior forces against you , aragorn .
you need more men .
there is no .
there are those who are the mountains .
murderer . back-stabber .
you want to go to fight ?
they believe nothing .
don &apos;t follow anybody .
the king of gondor will follow you !
andúril , the flame of the west , forged out of the pieces of narsil .
sauron won &apos;t have forgotten the sword elendils .
the blade , the broken ward , will return to minas tirith .
who can lead as powerful sword , can also create a force that is deadly than any on this earth .
leave the ranger behind you .
mind your destiny .
suggest the road to the dimholt .
i give people hope .
i don &apos;t keep hope for me .
why do you do that ?
the east is going to lead .
they &apos;re not depart at the battle of battle .
you cannot let the men down .
éowyn ...
we need you here .
why come in ?
don &apos;t you know that ?
it &apos;s just a shadow and a thought that you love .
i can &apos;t give you what you &apos;re looking for .
where do you want to go ?
this time you have to leave behind , gimli .
have you ever heard anything about the bloody-mindedness of the dwarfs ?
think about it .
we come with you , boy .
what &apos;s happened ?
where is he going ?
i don &apos;t realize that .
mr. aragorn !
why is he going to the battle of battle ?
he &apos;s because there &apos;s no hope anymore .
he &apos;s because he has to .
too few people have come .
we can &apos;t defeat the forces .
no , we can &apos;t .
and nonetheless , we &apos;re going to see them in the battle .
i &apos;ve left instructions .
thou shalt dominate by the people instead of the people .
take my place in the golden hall .
long , you mögest edoras when the battle becomes lost .
what other duty want to be enforce to me , sir ?
compulsory exercise ?
no .
i just want you to lächelst again and not for those of you who have come out of time .
you &apos;re going to experience hellere days and no despair .
what is the army holding to this place ?
one , which is cursed .
once again , the people of gebirges the last king of gondor is a oath , in the case of the struggle .
but when time came and gondor was at the highest level , it was fled and verbargen in dark places in the mountains .
it &apos;s so most cursed , they &apos;re never going to be quiet until their oath is full .
even the warmth of my affinity by consanguinity seems to have davongestohlen .
the path is obstructs .
he was designed by those who are dead .
and the dead hold it .
the path is obstructs .
brego !
i &apos;m not afraid death .
this is egregiousness !
a  goes below the earth and a dwarf , not ?
you &apos;d be in the ears forever .
we ride with little load and fast .
it &apos;s a further way .
man and animal can still fight if they &apos;ve let it come .
little hobbits are not in the war , mr. meriadoc .
all my friends moved into the fight .
i would be ashamed of myself .
it &apos;s a dreitagesritt after minas tirith .
you &apos;d be just a burden for my rider .
i want to fight !
this is my last word .
riding me .
mistress !
formed up you !
break out !

ride now to gondor !
who enters my rich ?
one who challenges your lehnstreue .
the dead people don &apos;t tolerate the living ones here .
i will tolerate lhr tolerate .
the path is obstructs .
he was designed by those who are dead .
and the dead hold it .
the path is obstructs .
now you have to die .
i urge you to fulfill your oath !
nobody , except the king of gondor , will give me commands .
this blade broke .
it was retranslation .
fight for us and get your honor back .
what does lhr say ?
what does lhr say ?
you vergeudest your time , aragorn .
they had no honor in life , and they don &apos;t have a death now .
i &apos;m a isildurs legacy .

you &apos;ve already done that .
éowyn , my body is crunches .
you have to let me go .
i go to my fathers , in their erlauchter society , i don &apos;t need to be ashamed now .
éowyn .
let &apos;s go free !
rather than .
you can have the guys , even though they &apos;re dead .
you gave us your word .
i look at your oath as a commodity .
go .

merry , i &apos;m ' .
i &apos;m ' , pippin !
i have known that you find me .
yeah .

i &apos;m going to worry for you .
paws away !
the top shirt owns me .
this comes to the great eye with everything else .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about stinkigen morgul-ratten .
if you anrührst it , i put this blade in the belly !
the dirty bastard wanted to stick me !
kills him !
this is for frodo !
and for the meadow landscape .
and this is for my old nuncle .
stop peep , you misthaufenratte .
bleed will be like a abgestochenes pig !
not when i get to you before .
sam !
oh , sam , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
let &apos;s get out here .
too late .
it &apos;s over .
they took it .
sam , you took the ring !
i &apos;m sorry , but you don &apos;t .
i thought i &apos;d lost you .
so i took him .
it &apos;s just to coffering him .
give him me !
give me the ring , sam .
sam !
give me the ring .
knowing that .
the ring is my load .
it will annihilating you , sam .
come on , mr. frodo .
let &apos;s look for some clothes .
you can &apos;t walk through a walk with nothing on your skin .
we did it , mr. frodo .
we &apos;ve reached mordor .
it &apos;s so many of you .
we never come through .
it &apos;s it . the eye .
we have to go through , mr. frodo .
it &apos;s not different .
come .
let &apos;s just start with the mountain for the beginning .
i won &apos;t see frodo in the distance .
the darkness takes off .
if sauron would have the ring , we would know .
that &apos;s just a matter of time .
he has suffered a defeat , yes , but behind the walls of mordors erstarkt our enemy .
he should stay there .
decay !
why should we care ?
because 10,000 orcs are now between frodo and the mount doom .
i sent him to death .
no .
there &apos;s still hope for frodo .
it takes time and a safe way across the plane of gorgoroth .
we can help it . how ?
we &apos;ve got to elicitation saurons force so that he denuded his country .
then we put our entire power up and march to the black gate .
we can &apos;t do that by waffenstärke achievement .
not for us .
but we can support frodo when saurons eye stays on us when we make sure that he &apos;s blind to everything else that moves .
a distraction .
sauron becomes a trap .
he &apos;s not going to let himself baiting .
death as a sense . less sense of success . what are we waiting for ?
to the gates , your lame sacks !
move you !
to the gates !
look ! orcs ! they pull off !
you see , mr. frodo ? finally , a little luck .
take mine .
some drop are still inside .
now there &apos;s nothing for the return path .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a return driver , mr. frodo .
frodo , down !
hide you !
frodo !
where are they ?
the black country is supposed to be emerge !
he &apos;s going to get his just punishment !
back . back .
it &apos;s continued , mr. frodo .
the light is moving north .
something state of distraction his gaze .
hold your seat !
sons gondors and rohans , my brothers !
in your eyes , i see the same fear that i &apos;m taking .
the day it may come , because the guts of people dried up , because we let our companions go down and band all the friendship .
but this day is not today .
the time of the wolves is ' &apos;s and zerschmetterter shields , because the age of people untergeht .
but this day is not today .
today we &apos;re fighting !
in everything that &apos;s expensive on this good earth , i &apos;m going to tell you : hang on , people of the west !
never would i have thought i &apos;d die page with a  battling .
and side side with a friend ?
yeah .
i could .
do you remember the meadow landscape , mr. frodo ?
there &apos;s spring soon .
then blossoming the obstbäume .
and the birds are building nests in the haselnussdickicht .
and they &apos;re going to disseminate the sommergerste on the lower fields and the first strawberries to eat with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
no , sam , i don &apos;t have a reminder of food , the sound of the water or the sound of the water .
i &apos;m nude in the darkness .
there &apos;s nothing , no veil between me and the catherine wheel .
i can see it . my eyes are eyes .
let &apos;s finally get rid of it . one for all time !
come on , mr. frodo .
i can &apos;t wear it for you , but i can wear you !
come on !
aragorn .
elessar !
for frodo .
there , mr. frodo .
a entrance .
we &apos;re almost there .
smart hobbits , so high climbing .
frodo !
eagles !
they breed !
frodo !
here i am , sam .
trash him !
do it ! now !
remove it into fire !
what are you waiting for ?
just let it go !
the ring belongs to me !
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
darling !
darling !
darling !
darling !
give me your hand .
take my hand !
no !
just don &apos;t go .
don &apos;t go .
grabs !
frodo !
frodo !
it &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s done .
yeah , mr. frodo .
now it &apos;s over .
i can see the meadow landscape .
the brandyweinfluss .
beutelsend .
gandalfs fireworks .
the lights at the festbaum .
rosie hüttinger dancing .
she was wearing loops in the hair .
if i ever had one married , she &apos;d been ' .
she &apos;d been ' .
i &apos;m happy to be with you , samweis gamdschie , here at the end of all things .
gandalf ?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
you might be blessedness .
this day is not a single man , but all of us .
let &apos;s rebuild the world together so we can share them in peacetime .
my friends , you don &apos;t mind anyone .
and so a third age broke in mittelerde .
the community &apos;s community , although forever , is connected to friendship and love , organized .
on the day 13 months after gandalf sent us on the long trip , a conscious sight offered us .
we were at home !
warning , jack-o'-lantern !
rosie , rosie !
good night , guys .
how do you make a living life ?
how do you keep doing it when you get deep in your heart , that there &apos;s no way back ?
some things can &apos;t cure time , some pain that &apos;s too deep and a clasps .
mr. frodo ?
what is ?
four years has passed since the day on wetterspitze , sam .
it &apos;s never really heals .
the story of a hobbits of bilbo baggins and the lord of frodo baggins
you &apos;re done .
not quite .
it &apos;s another place for a little more .
bilbo told me that his role in this story is that we all have to show up and disappear .
bilbos history was now over .
for him , there would be no travel anymore to one .
tell me another time , my boy . where do we go ?
the , bilbo .
the elves give you a special honor : a place on the last ship , leaving the mittelerde .
frodo ? could i even see my old ring ?
the one i gave you ?
sorry , uncle .
i &apos;m afraid i lost it .
shame .
i &apos;d like to put it in your hand last time .
this is a photograph i didn &apos;t have in my life .
the power of three rings has a end .
time has come to the rule of people .
the ocean will call us home .
i think i &apos;m beautifully equipped for another adventure .
you know , my brave hobbits .
my work is done .
so here , on the banks of the ocean , the end of our community comes .
i don &apos;t want to say weinet , because not all tears are malevolent .
it &apos;s so far , frodo .
what does he mean ?
we are losgezogen to save the meadow landscape .
and it &apos;s been saved .
but not for me .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s serious .
you can &apos;t depart !
the last pages are for you , sam .
my rather sam !
you cannot always be entzweigerissen .
you &apos;re going to have to be all the whole and the gadgets .
there &apos;s so much that you &apos;re excited about what you can be and do .
because your role in history continues , sam .
yeah . i &apos;m back .
my druther .
you asked me if i told you all stories about my adventure .
and i can say to you the truth always .
so i didn &apos;t tell you anything .
i &apos;m now old , frodo .
i &apos;m not the same hobbit i used to be .
i think it &apos;s time for you to erfährst what really happened .
it started a long time in a country in a country , and a country , like you don &apos;t find it all over the world today .
there was the city there .
with their long and wide known markets .
crops and wine in case and abundance .
peaceful and affluent .
because this city was in front of the shanghai kingdom in mittelerde .
erebor .
mountain fastness of thror , the king under the mountains , the most powerful of all zwergenfürsten .
thrors rule was unchallenged . he never doubted his house on his house , he was assured his son and his grandchildren .
oh , frodo , erebor .
deep inside the mountain , the beauty of this festungsstadt was most legendary .
their wealth was in the soil , in kostbaren edelsteinen , beaten out of the rock , and in huge goldadern , like rivers across the rock .
the skills of dwarfs were looking for everyone , and they created objects of the number beauty of diamonds , smaragden , ruby and sapphiric .
they killed deeper in the darkness .
and there they found him .
the heart of the mountain .
the arkenstein .
thror called him the königsjuwel .
he saw him as a sign to be the the chosen one king .
all huldigten him .
even the big one .
elbenkönig , thranduil .
as the wealth of the dwarfs grew , their good will increases .
nobody knows exactly what the falling-out triggered .
the elves say the dwarfs would have stolen their sweetie .
the dwarfs say the elbenkönig would have suffered their legal share .
it &apos;s sad , frodo , how old arrangements break , how to be lost between people .
and what ?
atrabiliousness streaked the days and mistrust dulled the nights .
thrors love for gold had become overly powerful .
a disease started growing in him .
a disease of mind .
and where disease is , it becomes very bad consequences .
the first thing you heard was a sound like a wild storm , which is from north heranbrauste .
the pine oil on the berghängen krachten and zerbrachen in the hot , dry wind .
balin , alarm alarm .
call the police station .
immediately !
thorin , what is that ?
a kite .
dragon !
it was a fire dragon from the north .
smaug had come .
death was mercilessness on that day .
the menschenstadt had nothing .
he had a different prey apart .
because gold alarm tone a dark , fiercest desire .
ah !
no !
fast , come on .
erebor was lost .
because a kite guarded his prey as long as he lives .
run your life !
ah !
help us !
thranduil didn &apos;t want to expose the life of the dragon to the dragon .
from the elves , there was no help that day , and no other day since .
their homeland bereaved , durchstreiften the dwarfs from the erebor , the wild . once a powerful people was feebleness and dampened .
the young zwergenprinz took every work he could find .
but he never forgot the smoke of the mountain in the moonlight , the bergwald , the bright night .
because he had seen the fire of the dragon in the sky and cities that were ashy .
and he never forgot and never forget .
far away , in another end of the world , kites were only a fantasy .
they fly .
move from zauberern to strongholds .
not furchterregender than pixie dust .
bilbo !
and at this point , my rather favorite thing , i get to play .
bilbo !
not .
it was the beginning of an unprecedented friendship that argument my entire life .
but that &apos;s not the beginning of my story .
for me , she started ...
well , she started to figure out how to do it .
in a hole in the ground , there was a hobbit .
not in a wet , dirty hole full of worms and fustiness .
no , the hole was a hobbithöhle , and that means good food .
thank you .
what is that ?
that &apos;s personal .
take your curious paws away .
it &apos;s not finished yet .
ready ? what ?
to read it .
what , in all the world , is this ?
answers to the invitation .
oh .
you my goodness .
is this today ?
everybody agreed .
except for the sackheim-beutlins . they want you to be einlädst .
so , do you want that , yes ?
only about the only thing about it .
you probably would be right .
my body .
they seem to believe that you have gold in the abundance .
a little box that &apos;s not übergequollen .
and they still stink for trollish .
what , in all the world , are you doing it ?
i meet arrangements .
i &apos;ve caught it when she wanted to leave the silver accompany .
who ?
lobelia sackheim-beutlin .
she had darned all my spoon into her pocket .
ha !
terrible dame .
promises me to have an eye on her when i ...
if i ...
if i ...
if you do what ?
oh , nothing .
nothing .
you know , some of you are thinking about you , uncle .
what ?
you know , you &apos;re going to be quaintest .
quaintest ?
oh . mmm .
and it &apos;s not affability .
not affability ?
i ? horseplay .
it &apos;s so good , and it hanged out the door .
do you think he &apos;s coming ?
who ?
gandalf .
oh , yeah .
it doesn &apos;t make it round up to fire its zauberknaller .
this becomes a real artifact . you &apos;re going to see .
all right .
i have to go .
where ?
the forest in ostviertel .
i want to surprise him .
well , just with you .
you still get too late .
he doesn &apos;t like it when you get too late .
oh no . not that i &apos;d ever come too late .
at that time i was always on time .
i was through honest .
and it never happened anything unexpected .
nice good morning .
what does that mean ?
do you want me a good morning , or do you think it &apos;s a beautiful morning , no matter what i wish ?
or your wanted say that you can find everything that morning and good ?
or you say , you need to be good at this morning or be beautiful ?
huh ?
all at the same time , i suppose .
yeah .
can i help you ?
that &apos;s where we go .
i &apos;m fighting an adventure , and i &apos;m looking for someone who &apos;s going to go .
an adventure ?
i don &apos;t think any western of bree has a lot of interest in abenteuern .
you have nothing to do with anger and scherereien .
and you get too late to eat .
ha , ha .
mhm .
really ?
yeah .
oh .
ah .
good morning .
i &apos;m going to abgewimmelt from belladonnna son &apos;s son with a good morning as if i sell buttons at the door .
how ?
you &apos;ve changed you . and not only for better .
bilbo baggins .
excuse me , i know you ?
well , you know my name , even though you don &apos;t know to me .
i &apos;m a gandalf .
and i &apos;m gandalf .
gandalf ?
the old tuk went to each sommersonnenwende lather .
ha . um .
no idea you &apos;re still in the business .
and where else should i be ?
well ...
ähem .
well , i &apos;m glad you know something else about me , and if it &apos;s just my fireworks .
yeah .
that would be decided .
it &apos;s going to do very well , and it will be very amusing for me .
i &apos;m going to share it to the other .
tell , who ?
what ?
no .
no ...
wait .
we have no use of adventure , at all .
neither today , nor ...
i propose you &apos;re trying to do it behind the hill or beyond the waters .
good morning .
tomorrow !
that &apos;s like that . please .
a beautiful day .
chum .
hello , mr. bilbo .
here , they feel like my nodule .
how beautiful they are .
fresh from the westviertel .

a big guy ?
long , grayer beard ?
spitzer hat ?

dwalin . in your service .

who said ?
yeah .
yeah .
very good that .
is there more ' ?
what ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
ah .
here , please , use you .
well ...
it &apos;s just that i didn &apos;t necessarily expect society .
that &apos;s probably the door .
balin . in your service .
good evening .
yeah .
yeah , he &apos;s good .
although i think it might rain afterwards .
am i getting too late ?
too late , what ?
oh !
ha , ha !
evening , brother .
in my barter , you &apos;ve become shorter and bigger for the last time .
wider , not shorter .
and even smart enough , for both of us .
uh , sorry , sorry .
i just hate , but i &apos;m not quite sure you &apos;re in the right house .
have you ever eaten ?
so , actually , i didn &apos;t go to visit . i guess , like any other hobbit .
but more than that , i appreciate it before he &apos;s visiting me .
what is that ?
no idea .
you should be cheese .
it &apos;s very blue .
swarms .
it &apos;s like , i don &apos;t know you both .
not at least .
i don &apos;t want to be rude , but that had to be said .
believe -- i &apos;m sorry .
sorry .
oh .
go full , brother . not so mingy .
let &apos;s taste it .
i could eat what if you get on it .
filicide .
kili .
in your service .
you must be mr. beuteler .
no !
you can &apos;t come in .
this is the wrong house .
what ?
is it blown off ?
we don &apos;t know anything about that .
it wasn &apos;t really blown off .
i &apos;m relieved .
careful with that .
i just ground them .
beautiful house . very nice here .
yeah .
did you build it yourself ?
what ?
no , it &apos;s been in family property .
this is the aussteuertruhe of my mother .
would you please leave that ?
filicide , kili , comes .
put it on .
mr. dwalin .
ha , ha .
put that in the hallway , we never get everybody in the hallway .
everybody ?
how many are there ?
where does it go ?
oh , no .
the thing is really hard .
no .
no .
it &apos;s no one at home !
just go again , bothered someone else .
it &apos;s too many dwarfs in my dining room .
if any blockhead allows you to joke a joke , i can only say it &apos;s very inelegance .
gandalf .
sorry , that &apos;s my chicken .
um ...
and if you don &apos;t please ...
and this is my wine .
i have to ask .
he says he feels slightly uncomfortable .
because a hand axe in his head ?
pegged out ?
no , it just brummt the skull .
his legs are still healthy .
think back .
put it back .
put it back .
not the jam pot .
sorry .
sorry .
lather exaggerated , right ?
have you a käsemesser ?
käsemesser ?
he &apos;s eating him all over .
oh .
no . this is gramps mungos chair .
no , and also .
bring it back , please .
i can &apos;t hear what you say .
a antique , not to sit .
this is a book , no table mat .
and let the card back please .
excuse me , mr. gandalf ?
yeah ?
would i be poisoning you to a cup camomile tea ?
oh , no , thank you , dori .
a drink red wine would like me .
caution .
oh .
yeah .
uh , filicide , kili .
uh ...
oin , gloin .
dwalin , balin , bifurcation , bofur , bombur .
dori , nori , original !
no .
not my preisgekrönten tomatoes .
no , thank you .
yes , you have absolutely right , bifurcation .
a dwarf is obviously lacking .
he just behind schedule .
he was walking north to meet our clan .
it will come .
mr. gandalf ?
a drink red wine , like desire .
he has a fruchtiges bouquet .
oh .
good news .
i think we should start . bombur eat his second lammkeule .
yeah .

not from the distance .
do we want to make mistakes ?
you wirfst like a girl .
ah , you blunderingly !
who wants a beer ?
please .
i want one , brother .
i said , drinkable water still .
drink out , three !
one , one .
two ... two ...
prostitution !
i knew what &apos;s inside you !
sorry , this is a lace doily and no dish towel .
but there are holes in there .
that &apos;s true too .
this is pillow-laced .
oh , nothing goes about a good punch-up . if you cast the right shot .
that you ruin the beards , this dwarf-sized !
i &apos;d rather bilbo , what &apos;s going on in the world ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m surrounded by dwarf-sized .
what do you want this ?
they &apos;re a very friskier gathering when you get used to them .
i don &apos;t want to get used to them .
look what my kitchen looks like .
the carpet is full of mud .
the food locker is harried .
from the bathroom to silence .
you &apos;ve got that as well as kaputtgemacht .
i don &apos;t realize what they want in my house .
i &apos;m sorry , if i give you , but what do i do with my plate ?
all right , original , give it to me .
carrier bag that back .
excused times .
that &apos;s the good westviertel-geschirr of my mother .
this is over 100 years old .
and , do you mind ?
you make it beveled .
oh , guys , have you heard ?
he said the knife are becoming beveled .
slashes the cloth of damask cloth
now , in fire , the old cork .
shipyard gates the glasses on the wall
what bilbo baggins does .

motoring jaunt the wine to every door .
the fat tramped the fat .
imbues conduces do a the world of good with beer .
cut out the bones .
undersaturated begs bed .
we crushing with the hand hand .
pots , bowls , china
and then it &apos;s still another .
something variable hallows .
let &apos;s start from the front of the line .
what bilbo baggins hates hates .
so , bilbo ?
he &apos;s there .
gandalf .
didn &apos;t you say that this place was easy to find ?
i got lost . 2-mal .
without the sign of the door , i couldn &apos;t have found ' at all .
sign ?
there &apos;s no sign .
it was just taken out a fresh way ago .
there &apos;s a sign .
i used it myself .
bilbo baggins . can i introduce you to the leaders of our activity ?
thorin eichenschild .
so , that &apos;s the hobbit .
is , mr. baggins , are you in the fight ?
right ?
ax or sword ?
what &apos;s your weapon ?
i throw a very elegant conker , if you want to know it , but i don &apos;t know how that should be meaning .
i thought i was ' .
more than a huckster than a master thief .
everybody came ?
yeah .
delegate of all seven kingdoms .
sounds most promising .
and what have the dwarfs said from the eisenbergen ?
does it include us ?
they won &apos;t come .
they say this journey is our thing . thorin : our own .
you go to a journey ?
bilbo , my dear friend , could we probably have more light ?
far in the east , behind gebirgen and rivers , beyond woods and badlands , there &apos;s a single , entlegener mountain .
the lonely mountain .
oin has interpreted the signs , and the signs is , the time is ripe .
you saw bad father that zurückflogen the mountain as it was geweissagt .
and when the birds go back to the age of age , the screwing will end up by the steals from .
uh ... what steals from ?
fliegender fire-breather .
teeth like cut-throat razor and claws like cambrel .
with a predilection for piece of precious metal .
yeah , i know what a kite is .
i &apos;m not afraid .
i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m going to do that , which is a zwergenklinge , right in his allerwertesten .
right , original !
and also , with an army in the back would be hard enough , but we &apos;re just 13 .
sit down .
neither 13 of the best ones nor the smartest .
hey , do you get about stupid ?
excuse me , what did he say ?
we don &apos;t like to be very many , but we &apos;re fighter . filicide : each of us .
and don &apos;t forget , we have a wizard in our rows .
gandalf has already killed hundreds of dragons .
oh , well , no .
i wouldn &apos;t say ...
how many then ?
what ?
how many dragons have you killed ?
there we go .
call us a number .
sorry .
please .
if we recognize the signs , then you don &apos;t think others can see ?
the rumors is already spreading .
the dragon hellcat was not for 60 years .
looking at the region of the east , the mountain , estimating , cogitating , the risk .
the vast wealth of our people is perhaps there .
let &apos;s just see how others are getting , what are we going to do ?
or do we take that opportunity and bring us back to the erebor ?
you remember , the main gate is locked .
there &apos;s no way in the mountain .
that , my rather balin , is not quite true .
how did you come to him ?
your father committed him .
thrain .
i should coffering him .
he &apos;s listening to you now .
if there &apos;s a key , there &apos;s a door .
these runes have a secret rail to the lower halls .
there &apos;s another entrance .
when we find it , closed nature are invisible .
the solution is hidden in this map , except i don &apos;t own the ability to find them , but there are others in mittelerde that can do that .
the truth i imagine is based on covertness , and i need a certain amount of courage .
but if we &apos;re careful and smart , i think we can do it .
that &apos;s why we need a master thief .
yeah .
that &apos;s a good one .
the best , i want to think .
and , are you ?
am i what ?
he said he &apos;s the best .
hey .
what , i ?
no .
i &apos;m not a burglar .
i &apos;ve never stolen anything in my life .
well , i &apos;m afraid i have to agree with mr. baggins .
it &apos;s not carved from diebesholz .
no .
yes , the wild is not a place for good people to fight nor to fight .
that &apos;s what he gets . look at him .
enough !
if i say that bilbo baggins is a master thief , he &apos;s a master thief .
hobbits are remarkable fleet-footed .
basically , they come to almost every unseen , if they want .
and while the dragon dwarfs without any other scenting , the smell of a hobbits is as good as unknown for him . what gives us a critical advantage .
i should find the fourteenthly member , and i decided to do mr. baggins .
in him , there &apos;s more than you can guess , and a lot more .
as he presages himself .
you have to trust me .
all right .
so , let &apos;s do ' .
-- no , no .
give him the contract .
here we go .
that &apos;s the usual one .
abstract , hours of labor , fee , begräbniskosten , and so on .
begräbniskosten ?
i can &apos;t guarantee for safety .
i understand .
i &apos;m still responsible for his destiny .
fair enough .
conditions : conditions .
act of paying at delivery , gain sharing a fourteenths of the gesamtprofits .
hmm .
it seems appropriate .
the signatory are not accountable for zugefügte , including ergebende injuries , including not entirely platzwunden , but not entirely platzwunden .
evisceration ...
combustion ?
well , he melts one in the handumdrehen of the bone .
all right , smaller ?
what ?
yeah , go .
just a little bit jittery .
imagine a winged furnace .
yeah , i have to get to the air .
yeah .
no .
oh , very helpful , bofur .
it goes right again .
i just want to rest , a moment .
you &apos;ve got a lot of time off .
tell me , when are the lace doily and your mother &apos;s worth of your mother so important ?
i remember a hobbit , which always ran on the road for elves through forests .
the long time , the long time , came to the dark , covered by mud and bits , followed by fireflies .
a young hobbit who would not have done anything rather than to explore what lies behind the boundaries of the meadow landscape .
the world is not in your books and maps .
it &apos;s out there .
i can &apos;t just go into the blue open .
i &apos;m a baggins from beutelsend .
you &apos;re also a tuk .
you know your ururururonkel .
bullenrassler tuk was so big that he could ride on a right horse ?
yeah .
yeah , it could .
in the battle of grünfeld , he went into the rows of the orcs .
he childbearing his club with such force that he abschlug the head of the head , which then flew 100 times through the air and fell into a kaninchenloch .
that &apos;s how the battle won .
and it was invented by the same time .
you just came up with this .
all good stories deserve to be most decorated .
you &apos;re going to have some to tell you if you &apos;re zurückkehrst .
can you promise me that i get back ?
no .
and if yet , you will be another one .
i thought .
sorry , gandalf , i &apos;m not signatory .
you have the wrong hobbit .
obviously we lost our master thief .
probably better .
our chances were never good .
and finally , who are we ?
business people , coal strike , kesselflicker , spielzeugmacher .
ha , ha .
not the fabric , from the legend .
there are some warriors among us .
old warrior .
i would prefer every single one of these dwarfs to an army from the eisenbergen .
because when i called them , they were .
allegiance , honor , a kämpferherz .
i can &apos;t ask anything more .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
you have a choice .
you were always honesty to our people .
you &apos;ve allowed us to have a new life in the blue mountains .
life in peace and abundance .
a life that is worth more than anything in the erebor .
from my grandfather , this is what came to me .
they träumten from the day that the dwarfs erebors erebors their home .
there &apos;s no choice , balin .
not for me .
then we stand in , boy .
we will do it .
about talking about about above .
the nebelberge .
to caves deeply deeply .
from age time .
there &apos;s ' n coming out there .
clucks profits .
through wind and weather , through wind .
adversity and suffering .
and where crackling crackling .
in the bosk
a brand fire .
of winds .
fanned fanned fanned
the sky is red .
the flame loht .
bergwald befackelt befackelt befackelt
bright the night .
hello ?
yeah .
yeah .
mr. bilbo , what &apos;s the holidays for ?
no time , i &apos;m too late .
too late , what ?
i get into an adventure .
i said ' .
did i not say ' ?
come on pure time .
that &apos;s true though .
närrischer thought , a mitzunehmen ride .
whose idea was that actually ?
wait !
wait !
wait , wait .
whoa , whoa .
i signed up .
here .
it seems to be all right .
welcome , master baggins , in the community of thorin eichenschild .
give him a bangs .
no , it won &apos;t be necessary .
thank you .
i can certainly keep on on foot .
because i &apos;ve been making a lot of moves , you know ?
even up to froschmoorstetten .
ah !
come on , nori .
pay .
please .
thank you , my boy .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , you &apos;ve completed a bet if you &apos;re auftauchst or not .
most people bet , you wouldn &apos;t do it .
what did you believe ?
oh ...
my dear friend , i don &apos;t have gezweifelt to you .
oh , horses' hair .
not so well .
no , wait , wait , stop .
stop !
we need to reverse .
i forgot my blowrag .
here .
take that .
and further .
you &apos;re going to have to do without handkerchiefs and lots of other things , bilbo baggins until we &apos;re at the end of our journey .
your home is the gentle hills and small rivers of the auenlandes .
but home faintness .
and the world is close .
hi , my little .
this is a braves girl .
that &apos;s what our little secret is , bay oil .
not telling .
psst , psst .
what was that ?
orcs .
orcs ?
halsschlitzer .
dozens of them out there .
in the empty land , it &apos;s all about you .
they &apos;re just going to break off when everything is sleeping .
fast and silent , nobody &apos;s screaming .
very much blood .
do you think that &apos;s fun ?
do you hold a ork-angriff at night for a joke ?
we didn &apos;t think about it .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know about the world .
don &apos;t take ' malevolent , my boy .
thorin has more reason than most people to hate orcs .
after the dragon rent the lone mountain , king thror challenged the ancient zwergenreich moria .
but our enemy was already there .
moria was taken by ork-scharen , led by the abscheulichsten of her whole people .
azog , the defiler .
the giant gundabad orcs had sworn , durins gender auszulöschen .
first , he beheaded the king .
no !
thrain , thorins father , powerplant the sorrow .
it was caught or killed , no one knew .
he disappeared .
we were without leaders .
defeat and death came over us .
yeah , and then i saw him .
a young zwergenprinzen who offered the bleaching orcs .
he left this horrible adversary .
with more torn up armor , nothing as a eichenast in your hands .
azog , the defiler , got to feel that day that the gender durins is not so easy to overcome .
our troops gathered up and kept the orcs back .
our enemy was defeated .
but not surprisingly , we , and no songs we sang in this night , because too many deaths we had to complain .
few of us had survived .
and then i said to myself , this one wants to follow one .
this one i can call king .
and the bleaching orcs ?
what has it become ?
he reconveyance into the hole that he came from .
this trash , a long time ago , is pegged out to his wounds .
mr. gandalf , could you do something about these flood-prone ?
it &apos;s raining , master dwarf , and it &apos;s going to weiterregnen until it stopped to rain .
want to change the weather in the world , you need to look for another magician .
what ?
what ?
other magicians ?
there are five of us .
the highest of our investiture is saruman , the white one .
and then there &apos;s two blue magicians whose name i have forgotten .
and who is the fifth ?
oh , of course , this is radagast , the brown .
is he a big magician , or is it more like you ?
i think he &apos;s a very big magician . he &apos;s in his way .
it &apos;s a gentle soul that vorzieht the society of animals .
he wakes up about the giant waldgebiete that span far in the east .
and that &apos;s good , because the evil will always try to grab foot in this world .
not good .
not good at all .
yuck .
oh no , sebaste .
you love kindness .
there you go . my god , you can &apos;t breathe .
that way .
here .
here .
i don &apos;t realize why it doesn &apos;t work .
that &apos;s not after all pishogue .
pishogue .
oh , but yeah .
a dark and a powerful magic .
where on earth does these widerlichen creatures come from ?
the old stronghold ?
would drive me .
this is where we beat our bivouac .
filicide , kili , takes the fringes .
and stay with them .
a farmer and his family lived here .
oin , gloin .
make a fire .
yes ?
right .
i think it would be smarter , weiterzuziehen .
we could go to the hidden valley .
i &apos;ve been told you .
we don &apos;t go near that place .
why not ?
the elves are helpful .
there we could eat , sleep , get advice .
i don &apos;t need any advice .
we have a map we can &apos;t read .
mr. elrond could help us .
help ?
a kite has attacked the erebor .
what help came from the elves ?
orcs plünderten moria , schändeten our holy halls .
the elves watched just watch inaction .
and you verlangst that i just said the call that told my grandfather ?
that told my father .
you &apos;re not both of them .
i gave you a map , and i didn &apos;t move to the past so you were going to go .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;ve heard you .
all right ?
gandalf , where do you want to go ?
i &apos;m looking for the society of the one who is still in significant mind .
and who is that ?
i , mr. baggins .
that was enough dwarfs for a day .
well , bombur , we &apos;re hungry .
is he coming back ?
it &apos;s been quite a long time .
who ?
gandalf .
he &apos;s a magician .
he does what he wants .
here , i love the guy , and i take these guys .
now end .
you had enough .
the potting is not even bad .
ever ate worse .
yes , what dori is always cooking .
ha , ha , ha .
the .
what &apos;s going on ?
we should take care of these fringes .
only we &apos;ve encountered a little problem .
we had 16 .
now it &apos;s 14 .
margerite and bungo are missing .
what ? so , that &apos;s not good .
ha , ha .
and that &apos;s not good at all .
shouldn &apos;t we say that ?
uh , no .
we didn &apos;t use it with it .
when our verbürgter master thief , you could follow the thing .
so , uh ...
one big thing has ripped out these trees .
well , we thought .
something very big , and possibly dangerous .
hey .
there &apos;s a light .
there it is .
stay down .
what is there ?
suitcase on wheels .
oh .
he has bay oil and minzi .
they will eat them .
we need to have what companies do .
yeah , undertakes .
bergtrolle are slowly and stupid , and you &apos;re so small that never see you .
nothing happens .
we &apos;re right behind you .
if there &apos;s a lot of anger in trouble , 2-mal schuhu like a schleiereule , and once a schnee-eule .
2-mal like a schnee-eule and once a ...
is that really a good idea ?
yesterday , muttonchops , muttonchops , and damnability me , if you don &apos;t have muttonchops the morning .

it &apos;s too fast .
come on , you guys ...
i have you .

i said , let &apos;s go down .
get the sacks .
put them in the sacks .
ow !
fast , up up .
bilbo !
no !
cut out the weapons , we pull it apart .
oh , again .
hot , hot , hot . hot !
we don &apos;t need to cook them .
we sit on them , and we most crushing them .
you should be  and cook out , and a soupçon sage strewing .
is that really necessary ?
it sounds really delicious .
i don &apos;t think so .
eat! somebody , who &apos;s the size of you .
forget the spices .
we don &apos;t have time .
it will soon be a day . we cut .
because i don &apos;t intend to become stone .
wait !
you just make a horrible mistake .
you can &apos;t talk to them .
these are dunce !
dunce ?
and then what are we ?
i mean , what the spices is .
yes ? what about the gewürzen ?
did you smell about those ?
you &apos;ve got to have something like kräftigeres when you &apos;re going to get on the plate .
back-stabber ! what do you know from cooking dwarf-sized ?
hold it up .
let the kleisterdings-meisterhobbit excuses go .
the secret to dwarfs cooking is that ...
yes ?
tell us the secret .
the secret is , you just peeling .
so , um ...
yeah , i do .
are you crazy ?
tom , get my scharfes knife .
i get the skin off , you mieser back-stabber !
i don &apos;t forget that .
i don &apos;t forget that .
but this is all stupid babble .
i &apos;ve been eating a lot of my skin .
i say we stowing away them as they are .
he &apos;s right .
a bite raw product dwarf can never hurt .
fresh and crispness .
oh , not there .
it &apos;s contaminated .
what ?
what is it ?
yes , he has worms in his gedärmen .
yuck !
ah !
contaminates are all together .
they &apos;re completely verwurmt , to fleetingly .
lousier matter .
i wouldn &apos;t risk that , honestly .
worms ?
did he say worms ?
we have no worms .
you have worms .
what &apos;s the daffery , little ?
i have worms as thick as my arm .
my worms are the most absolutely biggest .
i have huge worms .
yeah , i &apos;m a verwurmt .
i &apos;m also verwurmt .
yes , contaminates and through .
yeah , and what should we do now ?
let &apos;s all run again ?
well ...
do you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ?
the little frettchen thinks that we are fools .
frettchen ?
fools ?
the day is supposed to meet you .
who is that ?
no idea .
can we eat that too ?
oh , take the foot from my cross .
ah .
where were you abgeblieben ?
take a look ahead .
what did you do ?
look at the back .
that was annoying .
after all , all the colonies have remained .
you don &apos;t thank your master thief .
he had enough brains to win time .
none of you came up with this .
they have to come from the ettenöden .
so , when a car is moving so far in the south ?
oh .
they didn &apos;t do that forever .
a dunklere power was in the back of this country .
you can &apos;t be outside at daylight .
that means there &apos;s a cave near that .
oh , what &apos;s this smell ?
it &apos;s a troll-hort .
watch what you &apos;re doing .
but if it &apos;s a bad thing to do here .
you could take it .
i see that way .
nori .
yes ?
get a dustpan .
this crossed swords mark has no trollish forged .
and just as little as human beings .
they were made in gondolin , from the hochelben of the first age .
you can &apos;t wish a blade .
quick , this is still true .
it &apos;s good .
and now bury .
so , we then pay out the numbers later .
nothing like out of this widerwärtigen hole .
come on . we should go .
bofur , gloin , nori .
bilbo .
yes ?
here .
it fits your size .
it &apos;s not .
elves forged this blade , which means it &apos;s blue blue , as soon as orcs or bilwisse are near .
i &apos;ve never made a sword in life .
and i hope you &apos;ve never got to .
now , if you think about it .
true courage doesn &apos;t mean to be able to take life , but to preserve it .
there &apos;s something !
gandalf .
sit together !
scuds you !
guns you !
filchers !
fire !
mordio !
radagast .
this is radagast , the brown .
so ...
what , in all the world , are you here ?
i looked for you , gandalf .
something is wrong .
something is completely true .
yes ?
oh .
let me just pause .
oh .
i had a thought , and now i &apos;m been omitted .
it was there , it &apos;s been on my tongue .
oh .
it wasn &apos;t even thought .
it &apos;s just one ... stabschrecke .
the grünwald is sick , gandalf .
a dark has shrunk it .
nothing battens more .
at least nothing good .
the air googled decay .
but the worst is nets .
nets ?
what do you mean with that ?
spiders , gandalf .
huge .
if that &apos;s not ungoliants , i don &apos;t want to be a magician .
i followed them .
they came from dolomite quicklime guldur .
what ?
dolomite quicklime guldur ?
the old stronghold is left .
no , gandalf .
it &apos;s not .
a dark power resided into her , as i &apos;ve never felt .
it &apos;s the shadow of an ancient grauens .
one who can call forth the minds of the dead .
i saw it , gandalf .
the darkness is a necromancer entstiegen .
radagast .
watch up !
quick !
quick , quick !
wait me !
sorry .
take a train ages .
it helps to calm down nerves .
and out .
so , a necromancer .
are you sure ?
this is not from the world of living .
was that a wolf ?
are there wolves out there ?
wolves ?
no , that &apos;s not a wolf .
kili !
get your bow !
warg-späher .
then the ork-meute can &apos;t be tv .
ork-meute ?
who , except your clan , did you tell from your purpose ?
nobody .
who knows ?
no one , i swear .
what , in durins names , is going on here ?
you &apos;re going to hunt to you .
we have to disappear here .
we can &apos;t .
we have no fringes .
they are qualified .
i &apos;m going to lure away them .
these are gundabad-warge .
you &apos;ll catch up .
and these are rhosgobel-kaninchen .
they &apos;ll try it quietly .
come on .
come on .
come on and start me !
ha , ha !
come on . fast .
stay together .
further !
original , no !
back .
everybody . come on .
where do you pay us ?
there !
run !
there they are !
here !
quick !
there &apos;s more !
shoots .
we &apos;re surrounded !
where is gandalf ?
he &apos;ll let us down .
hold up !
here , you fools !
hurry you !
fast !
everybody down !
go ahead , go on .
go , go , go .
eight , nine , 10 , 10 .
kili !
run !
elves .
do we follow him or not ?
we naturally follow him .
that would be the cleverest .
gandalf ?
where are we ?
do you spürst it ?
yeah .
it feels like ...
well , like magic .
and that &apos;s what it is .
a very powerful magic .
there &apos;s light on the front .
the valley of imladris .
it &apos;s known under another name .
bruchtal .
here &apos;s the last more homelike house east of the lake .
that &apos;s what you had from the beginning .
asylum in our enemies .
enemies are not there , thorin eichenschild .
the only dudgeon that you find in this valley is the one you hegt .
do you think the elves of our imagination will be your blessing ?
you will want to stop it .
of course , they will .
but we have questions that we need to answer .
if we want to succeed , we have to deal with consideration .
and respect .
and there &apos;s a big degree of charm .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to talk to me .
mithrandir .
ah .
lindir .
it &apos;s on the hat .
i have to talk to mr. elrond .
my lord elrond is not here .
not here ?
where is he ?
hold the rows !
gandalf .
mr. elrond .
so unusual for orcs , to come close to our border .
something or somebody would probably kill you .
ah .
we could have been .
welcome , thorin , son of the thrain .
i don &apos;t think we know .
you have your grandfather &apos;s appearance .
i knew thror when he knew him .
king was under the mountains .
yeah ?
he never talked about you .
what did he say ?
was that about an insult ?
no , master gloin , just an invitation to eat .
well , if this is , it goes forward .
come on . come on .
try it .
a tiny tiny bit . just to .
no , green food i don &apos;t like .
where is the meat ?
or gebratene potatoes ?
thank you for having me .
if i &apos;m not dressed for dinner too .
you &apos;re never here .
not quite my taste , the elbenmädchen . it &apos;s thin .
the high wangenknochen , the seidene skin .
too little facial hair , i find .
however , it &apos;s not bad .
this is not a elbenmädchen .
very funny .
this is orkrist , the orkspalter .
a famous blade , forged from the west of the west , my clan .
may you do good services .
and this is glamdring , the feindhammer .
sword of the king of gondolin .
these crossed swords mark were made for the orkkriege in the first age .
don &apos;t mind .
crossed swords mark are called for the greater part , which they do in war .
does that mean , my sword has no battle yet ?
i don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s a sword .
it looks like a letter opener .
how are they going to be in your property ?
we found them in a troll-hort , at the big oststraße . shortly after that , we found them .
überfielen impeccancy .
and what do you do on the great scale ?
excused me .
13 dwarfs and a halflin halfling .
yeah .
strange reisegefährten , gandalf .
these are the offspring of the house .
noble , decent people .
and surprisingly sophistication .
they &apos;re big admirer .
art .
do you even do something else ?
i &apos;m going to get on a funeral .
did anybody die ?
all right boys , i think there &apos;s only one .
old jar jar .
old jar jar .
in the old bellarmine .
likewise , the liability bias .
and they put a beer in the moon as brown as the man in the moon .
look and lay out .
in the hum period long .
oh oh .
the yes-man yes-man had .
plays fiedel fulltime .
his bow saws the strings .
so , squealing .
so , brummt .
in sight , no end .
the one of the world &apos;s brains .
hangover plays playing .
hei-didel-dum arouse , when he called the dead results
he saws and plays the sound quickly .
and the mondmann call :
it &apos;s going to be bright .
and the bell longitudinal girder 3 .
our actions don &apos;t go to the elves .
the map is the legacy of my people , and it &apos;s to protect them . you mean my goodness , thorin .
just like your secrets .
marcus : i mean , somebody in front of the bloody-mindedness according to which .
your pride is still going to be your demise .
you &apos;re here before one of the few in mittelerde who can read this card .
show mr. elrond .
thorin , no .
erebor ?
what are you interested in this map ?
it &apos;s mostly gedankenspiele .
as you know , these pieces contain at times hidden texts .
you can read the old zwergisch , right ?
mondrunen .
of course .
it &apos;s easy to overlook .
in this case , that &apos;s true .
you can read it just in the light of a moon that &apos;s equivalent to the stage and the season that you &apos;re written to .
do you mind reading her ?
these runes were written on the evening of a zunehmenden , a growing moon , about 200 years ago .
apparently , it &apos;s been determined to come to bruchtal .
the fate is weighed .
thorin eichenschild , because the same moon seems tonight .
imagine the gray rock when the throttles hits , and the untergehende sun held office its final beam on the durinstag .
drop down is on the keyhole .
durinstag ?
the first day of the new year of dwarfs , when the last autumn moon and the first winter sun are in the sky .
bad news .
the summer goes on .
the durinstag will soon be there .
we still have time .
time ?
what ?
finding the entrance .
we need to be right in the right place , right at the right time .
and then only then , the door can be opened .
so that &apos;s your intention . you want to go into the mountain .
and if it was ?
some of one would not be a wisest .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s anschickt over mittelerde .
i don &apos;t want to hear excuses .
uh -- i &apos;m certainly not going to miss .
in fact , most people , i should not be on this journey .
in fact ?
i heard hobbits are very resilient .
really ?
mhm .
and i heard they schätzten the comfort of their repatriate .
i heard it &apos;s imprudentness to look for the advice of the elves , because they always respond with yes and no .
you &apos;re very welcome when you wish it , hierzubleiben .
but you did exactly the same thing .
don &apos;t do so innocent .
dori !
here , take this .
bombur !
of course , i wanted to tell you .
right at this opportunity .
you can &apos;t trust that i know what i do .
this kite has slept for 60 years .
what if your plan fails ?
if you shake the steals from ?
and if we do it ?
when the dwarfs reconquering the mountain , our defense is empowered in the east .
it &apos;s a dangerous step , gandalf .
it &apos;s also dangerous to do nothing .
the were enthroned of erebor is thorins legacy .
what do you fear ?
have you forgotten it ?
there &apos;s a bias to madness in this family .
his grandfather lost the mind .
his father is the same disease .
can you recall that thorin eichenschild doesn &apos;t anheimfällt you too ?
gandalf , these decisions are not alone with us .
it &apos;s not you nor me to draw the map of mittelerde .
or without our help , these dwarfs are going to march to the mountain .
they &apos;re determined to zurückzufordern their home .
i don &apos;t think thorin eichenschild of opinion is to be guilty .
that &apos;s not me .
not to give me responsibility .
woman galadriel .
mithrandir .
i didn &apos;t know that mr. elrond sent to you .
he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s me .
ah .
saruman .
you &apos;re quite activities , my friend .
tell me , gandalf , did you think you were serious , you &apos;d stay in the shields ?
notice ?
no .
i just do what i mean for right .
the dragon &apos;s going on for you .
that &apos;s true , mistress .
smaug is no allegiance .
but if he ally with the enemy , this kite would have an incredibly devastating effect .
what enemy ?
gandalf , the enemy is defeated .
sauron became defeated .
he will never return his full strength .
don &apos;t you mind that the last of the zwergenringe just disappears ? together with the guy wearing it ?
from the seven zwergenringen , four of the dragons were destroyed . two had sauron , before he unterging in mordor .
the ability of the last zwergenringes remains unknown .
the ring , the thrain .
without the ruling ring of power , the seven rings are no value for the enemy .
to mastery the rest of the rings , he needs one .
this ring was lost a long , long time ago .
it was hinausgespült into the sea . it was the floods of the anduin .
gandalf , for 400 years , we &apos;ve been living in peace now , and we &apos;ve been living in peace and schützenswerten peace .
do we have that ?
do we have peace ?
suitcase on wheels are moving from mountains into the valleys .
they steal villages , destroying courts .
orcs were attacking us on the street .
hardly a cause to war .
they always have to involve you , and look for problems where none are .
let &apos;s talk it .
here &apos;s something that is a lot more bösartiger than smaug .
something far more mächtigeres .
we can look away , but i promise you , it &apos;s not going to release us .
the grünwald is sick .
the waldmenschen there call him düsterwald .
and they say ...
yes ?
go on .
tell us what the waldmenschen are saying .
they talk about a nekromanten in dolomite quicklime guldur .
a sorcerer that can leave the dead resurge .
that &apos;s absurd .
there &apos;s no such power in this world .
this necromancer is nothing more than a mortal being person .
it &apos;s a charlatan that tries to be in black magic .
and that &apos;s what i was .
but radagast saw ...
radagast ?
don &apos;t tell me about radagast , the brown .
he &apos;s a einfältiger goop .
well , he &apos;s strange , i &apos;ll admit .
he &apos;s leading a einsames life .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s actually due to its maßlosen of mushrooms .
through it , his brain has become soft and his teeth are yellow .
i warned him .
it &apos;s not beseems to be wrong in such a state in the state of forests .
your carrier bag is something .
you &apos;ve got it from radagast .
he found it in dolomite quicklime guldur .
yeah .
show me .
listen .
you could have thought , i did soliloquies , most inattentive , as he was .
of course , it &apos;s important to understand the wisdom of all beings , but ...
what is that ?
a relic of mordor .
a morgulklinge .
forged for hexenkönig hexenkönig .
and he was buried with him .
as a angmar unterging , people took their body , and everything he owned , and they locked it into the felshöhen of rhudaur .
deep in the stone , they put it in a crypt , so dark that no light ever reaches it .
that &apos;s not possible .
a powerful magic is on these grüften .
they can &apos;t be opened .
what &apos;s evidence for that that this gun comes from the hexenkönigs grave ?
i don &apos;t have one .
there is no one .
let &apos;s go to what we know .
a single crowd orcs orcs over the bruinen .
a sword of one last age was found .
and a human conjuror , which is called the necromancer , has a ruins of the fortress most domestic .
that &apos;s essentially not a lot .
but the purpose of this zwergischen activity worries me deeply .
i &apos;m not convinced , gandalf .
i can &apos;t be approve of this way .
if they had come to me , i would have saved those disappointment .
i don &apos;t understand your reasons why you &apos;ve made hope , gandalf .
they break up .
yeah .
you did .
no . there &apos;s no more to say .
my lord elrond .
the dwarfs , they continue .
get all the good eight .
right now , we cross the border to the wilderness .
balin , you know these pathways , go ahead .
yeah .
champion baggins , it &apos;s time to sputen .
you will follow them .
yeah .
you &apos;re right to help thorin eichenschild .
but i &apos;m afraid that this business has forces that we don &apos;t understand yet .
the mystery about the morgul-klinge needs to be solved .
something moves in darkness . unseen , hidden in front of our view .
it won &apos;t show up .
not yet .
but every day it gains strength .
be on the hat .
mithrandir ?
why the halflin halfling ?
i don &apos;t know .
saruman is the idea that only big power can fall evil .
but i learned different .
i think these are the little things , everyday , of ordinary people that keep the darkness away .
simple did kindness and love .
why bilbo baggins ?
maybe because i fear , and he gives me courage .
don &apos;t fear you , mithrandir .
you &apos;re not alone .
careful !
slowly .
ah !
bilbo !
we need to find a shelter !
caution !
brother , watch up !
covering up !
this is not a rolling thunder .
this is a donnerschlacht !
see !
kinder skies .
the legends are true .
giant !
steinriesen !
get out , goop !
hold !
what &apos;s going on here ?
take my hand !
run , go , go !
fast , run .
way , gone here !
fast !
warning !
warning !
spring !
do it !
hang on !
no !
no !
no !
kili !
nothing happens !
they &apos;re alive !
where is bilbo ?
where is the hobbit ?
there !
help him !
ah !
hang on !
bilbo !
original , be careful !
grabs my hand !
i have you , boy .
just turn up !
push !
go .
up with him .
come on , boy .
up with you .
we almost had lost our master thief .
he &apos;s lost since we &apos;re open .
he should never have come back .
he &apos;s not listening to us .
dwalin !
it seems safe .
look at the back .
antarctica in mountains are rarely uninhabited .
here &apos;s nothing .
all right , let &apos;s just make a nice fire .
no .
no fire .
not here .
nightcap a little .
at break of day we go on .
we should be waiting in the mountains until gandalf to come in .
that was the plan .
plans change .
bofur , takes over the first board .
so where do you want to go ?
back to bruchtal .
no , you can &apos;t reverse now .
you &apos;re part of the job .
one of us .
that &apos;s not true .
thorin says i should never have come up , and he &apos;s right .
i &apos;m not a tuk .
i &apos;m a baggins .
what was i thinking about that ?
i &apos;d never had to go away from home .
you have homesickness .
i understand that .
no .
you don &apos;t understand that .
that doesn &apos;t understand any of you .
you are dwarfs .
you &apos;re used to this .
a life on the street , no settling , no hinzugehören .
forgiveness , i didn &apos;t want to ...
you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
i wish you all happiness in the world .
totally honest .
what is that ?
what ?
wake up !
wake up !
oh , man !
watch up ! watch .
away with you !
dirties pack !
let &apos;s go there !
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do !
now i have you .
all right , stop pitchfork .
take your dirty paws from me .
let me go !
let me go !
before you know self-killing , i sing a song .
pack , hack pincers and pinch
flus ears : while got ears
bludgeon and flick .
until their day of woe
and bewails bewails .
off , down to the end .

jaaa !
go into the ear , right ?
one of my own compositions .
this is not a song , it &apos;s a abomination .
abomination .
mercilessness .
cruelty .
that &apos;s all you find down here .
who persuaded it to get armed in my kingdom ?
spies ?
filchers ?
mordgesindel ?
dwarfs , your cattiness .
dwarfs ?
they were in the front lobby .
so , what do you do ?
checking them .
from the top to the bottom , from all sides .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re your wulstigkeit that you do with the elves common thing .
built in bruchtal . ah .
second age .
completely worthless .
but just a few memory .
what led you to this area ?
no fear , friends .
i do it .
huh ?
what is ?
no lies !
i want the truth , the pure truth .
you &apos;ve got to talk a little bit more louder .
your sizzled zertrampelt my funnel opening .
i zertrampele more than your funnel opening .
if you want to know more , you should talk to me .
mhm-hm .
we were on a road .

more cursed halflin halfling .
it &apos;s gone now .
i thought he &apos;d be at dori !
don &apos;t put it on me .
where did you see it last ?
i think when they caught us , he could davonstehlen .
what &apos;s happening ?
talk !
i tell you what happened .
champion baggins has recognized the opportunity and it was moving .
since he got out of his door , he was just thinking of his silkiness bed and his warm oven .
we &apos;re not going to go back to our hobbit .
it &apos;s continued , it &apos;s long .
he &apos;s not .
bilbo baggins .
in my entire life , i &apos;ve never been so happy to see someone .
bilbo .
we had given you up .
how do you go to the orcs ?
good question .
what does it matter to ?
he &apos;s back here .
it plays a role .
i want to know .
why are you back here ?
i know you &apos;re going to go back to me , and that &apos;s the beginning .
and you &apos;re right .
i often think of beutelsend .
i missed my books .
and my chair . my garden .
there i am .
this is home .
and that &apos;s why i came back .
a home .
it was taken to you .
but i want to help you bring back .
out of the pan .
in the fire .
run .
run !
up to the trees !
everybody ! immediately !

thorin !
thorin .
the halflin halfling ?
don &apos;t worry .
bilbo is here .
it &apos;s keeping well .
you !
what did you do ?
that could have cost you .
didn &apos;t i say , you were a load ?
you don &apos;t überlebst in the wild ?
that you will never belong to us ?
i &apos;ve never deceive myself . all my life .
forgiveness my doubt on you .
no . i &apos;d just gezweifelt myself .
i &apos;m not a hero . and not a warrior .
not even a master thief .
is that what i think ?
our home .
a bad father !
the birds go back to the mountain .
that , my rather oin , is a throttles .
but we see it as a sign .
as a good omen .
right .
the worst thing is , i would say .
[ germanophilia germanophilia germanophilia
i die of thirst over here !
come on .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
caution !
sorry , love .
you know , get ' .
thank you .
champion barn .
can i dazugesellen ?
the same thing for me .
i should imagine .
my name is gandalf .
gandalf of gray .
i know who you are .
well , that &apos;s a enjoyable coincidence .
what leads thorin eichenschild to bree ?
i &apos;ve learned that my father had been seen in the wild at dunland .
i looked for him , but couldn &apos;t find him .
thorin , you haven &apos;t heard anything about thrain for a long time .
he &apos;s still alive .
i &apos;m sure .
before my dad disappeared , he visited you .
what did you say to him ?
i was thronged him to march the erebor , to congregating the 7 of the dwarfs , to kill the dragon and bring back the lone mountain .
and i would say the same thing .
get your home back .
this encounter is not an accident , or , gandalf ?
no .
it &apos;s not .
the lonely mountain worries me , thorin .
this kite has been long enough .
or sooner or later , dunklere intentions are erebor .
on the grünweg , i came up with a couple of cruder design .
they thought i was a rovers .
what you probably have regrets .
one of them had a message to themselves .
this is black language .
a reward is promised .
what ?
your head .
someone wants your death .
thorin , you no longer wait for are allowed to .
you &apos;re the legacy of durins were enthroned .
united states is united .
together , you have the power , the erebor zurückzuerobern .
aurora is a gathering of 7 zwergenvölker .
it requires you to stand up to your oath .
the seven armies have the oath of the sworn who &apos;s wearing the königsjuwel .
the arkenstein .
and if you &apos;ve forgotten , this gem was stolen , from smaug .
what if i help you , zurückzubekommen ?
how ?
the arkenstein is far away from here , buried under a fire speienden .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
and that &apos;s why we need a master thief .
how close is the mob ?
too close .
some wegstunden , more not .
but it &apos;s even worse .
do we have scented ?
not yet .
but you will .
we have a problem .
did you see ?
you &apos;ve been seeing .
no , it &apos;s not .
what did i tell you ?
completely quiet .
it &apos;s appropriate .
would you please listen ?
i &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s something else up there .
what shape ?
one bear ?
yeah ...
yes , but bigger .
much bigger .
you knew about this steals from ?
i say we &apos;ve come .
to get caught from orcs caught ?
there &apos;s a house , it &apos;s not far from here , and there we could go asylum .
whose house ?
my doody ?
neither nor .
it will help us or kill us .
have we a choice ?
no .
run !
along here .
fast !
run !
bombur , come on !
home !
run !
go in there .
open the door !
fast !
squeeze !
squeeze !
dwalin !
come on , guys !
what is that ?
that &apos;s our host .
his name is beorn .
and he &apos;s a hautwechsler .
sometimes he &apos;s a giant black bear , sometimes a great strong person .
the bear is unpredictable , but people are beizukommen with reason .
but he doesn &apos;t value dwarfs .
it disappears .
come away from the door .
that &apos;s not natural .
none of it .
it &apos;s obvious .
a dark curse is on him .
not most foolish .
the magic is part of him .
well , let &apos;s all sleep .
here you are safe tonight .
i hope anyway .
so you &apos;re the one they call eichenschild .
tell me , why does azog azog hunt to you ?
you know from azog ?
where ?
my people was the first to live in the mountains before the orcs came out of the north .
the defiler has almost killed my entire family .
but some people thought he was a slave .
not to work , to the pastime .
hautwechsler einzusperren and to torture , seemed to be amuse .
is there more like you ?
once there were many .
and now ?
now there &apos;s one more thing .
you have to reach the mountain before the last herbsttagen .
it &apos;s marriage of the durinstag .
yeah .
you don &apos;t have a lot of time .
that &apos;s why we have to go through the düsterwald .
a dark lies over this forest .
cruel beings crawl around the brush .
the orcs of moria and the necromancer in dolomite quicklime guldur have ally .
just in the number of adversity i would be there .
we &apos;re going to take the elbenweg .
it &apos;s certainly safe .
sure ?
the waldelben of the düsterwalds are different .
they &apos;re less smart , they &apos;re dangerous .
but what does it do .
how do you mean that ?
in this area , it &apos;s about orcs .
it &apos;s increasing more .
and you &apos;re on foot .
you &apos;ve never reached this forest alive .
i don &apos;t like dwarfs .
they &apos;re greedy and blind .
blind to the lives of those who are holding them for less than themselves .
but i hate more .
what do you need ?
right now .
as long as it &apos;s bright .
they &apos;re going to hunt , no longer .
the elbentor .
here &apos;s our path through the düsterwald .
not to see orcs .
happiness is on our side .
let the fringes now go free .
you should return to your gentleman .
this forest seems to be kind of sick .
it &apos;s like affectedness from one suffering .
is there really no way around ?
only if we go to the south of 200 miles or five miles to south .
something moves in darkness . unseen , hidden in front of our view .
every day it gains strength .
herded you before the nekromanten .
he &apos;s not what he seems to be .
if our enemy is back , we need to know .
go to the grüften in the mountains .
the felshöhen .
it &apos;s like that .
my horse doesn &apos;t !
i need it !
do you want to leave us ?
i wouldn &apos;t have to do it if i didn &apos;t have to .
you changed you , bilbo baggins .
you &apos;re no longer the guy who has left the meadow landscape .
i wanted to tell you something .
i found something in the orkstollen .
what ?
what did you find ?
my courage .
good .
well , that &apos;s good .
you will need them .
i expect you at the aussichtsposten edge of the erebor .
coffered the map and the key .
not without me in the mountain .
this forest is not the grünwald of erstwhile .
even the air in the forest is full of deceptive appearances .
he &apos;s going to try to make your mind be wrong .
we have our minds go crackers ?
what does that mean ?
you have to stay on the path .
doesn &apos;t come from him .
if you do it , you &apos;ll never find it .
whatever happens , it stays on the way .
come on .
we have to reach the erebor before the sun ends up on the durinstag .
durinstag ?
then go .
we can only find the secret door in the mountain .
this is where the path continues .
along here .
i don &apos;t get air .
my head swimming everything .
what &apos;s going on ?
go on .
nori , why are you staying standing ?
the path , it &apos;s gone .
what &apos;s going on here ?
we lost the way !
get it .
all right , everybody , addiction .
look the way .
and that &apos;s not what i remember .
nothing familiar with me .
he has to be here .
what did we have ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t even know which day we have .
does this most cursed forest take no end ?
atterkopp .
see .
a tobacco pouch .
there are dwarfs in this forest .
dwarfs from the blue mountains .
it looks like mine .
it &apos;s yours too .
do you understand ?
we walk around .
we lost ourselves .
we don &apos;t .
we go to the east .
and where is east ?
we lost the sun .
i thought you &apos;re masters in the field .
the sun .
we have to find them , the sun .
up there .
we need to go beyond the treetop .
what is that ?
now that &apos;s enough .
be silent ! everybody !
we &apos;re observed .
i see a lake !
and a river .
and the lone mountain .
we &apos;re almost there !
do you hear me ?
i know where we need to go .
hello ?
hello .
oh no .
oh , not yet .
kill them !
kill them .
eat the same as long as your blood flows .
your fur is stringily , but inside you &apos;re beautiful .
do it again .
do it again .
kill it .
the meat is mercurial !
kill him .
now kill him .
let &apos;s eat .
eat !
eat !
eat !
eat !
eat alive !
eat !
what is there ?
what is there ?
eat alive !
fat and juiciest .
just a little bit .
cursed !
where is it ?
where is it ?
here .
ah !
it cutoff date !
cutoff date !
clean .
a good name .
clean .
all right , bofur ?
i don &apos;t have anything .
away , pull it away !
where is bilbo ?
i &apos;m up here !
take the legs !
pull !
pull !
oh , where is he ?
where is he ?
come .
where is he ?
no !
no !
no !
go ahead , quick now !
hurry you !
come on !
watch up , brother !
filicide !
mine .
come on , quick now !
they &apos;re gone .
don &apos;t think i would kill you , dwarf .
it would be a pleasure .
help !
kili !
shipyard gates me over .
fast !
if you think i &apos;m going to give you a gun , it &apos;s dwarf you .
checking them .
hey !
give it to this !
that &apos;s personal .
who is that ?
your brother ?
and the other , gräuliche creature ?
a ork-wechselbalg .
this is my little boy . gimli .
how did you do that ?
it was given to me .
not just a burglar , but also a liar .
thorin , where is bilbo ?
that &apos;s going to be leidtun .
you heard ?
let &apos;s get out here !
don &apos;t grab me !
don &apos;t you want to go through me ?
i could have anything in the silence .
or nothing .
let &apos;s do that !
we &apos;re not coming out here !
this is not a orkverlies .
these are the halls of the waldland-reiches .
nobody &apos;s coming out here without the acceptance of the king .
your journey may have a hehren objective .
you want to kill your home and kill a dragon .
i even suspect behind your action , rather noble motives .
you perform an theft or something like that .
you found a way into it .
you &apos;re looking at what gives you the right to rule .
the königsjuwel .
the arkenstein .
it &apos;s valuable for you all orders .
i understand that .
and in this mountain , there are gems , which i conation .
white stones from pure light .
i offer you my help .
i &apos;m completely ear .
i &apos;m going to leave you when you give me what my is .
a favor for you .
i &apos;ll give you my word .
from one king to another .
i don &apos;t think thranduil , the great king , is holding his word , even though the end of all the days .
you don &apos;t have any honor .
i saw how you treat your friends .
once we came to you , famishing , homelessness , and asked for your help .
but you get away .
you don &apos;t have any share of my people &apos;s suffering , and the holocaust that annihilates us .
don &apos;t tell me about the drachenfeuer .
i know how angry and deadly it is .
i &apos;ve been struggling against the great feuerschlangen of the nordens .
i warned your grandfather what to do .
he didn &apos;t want to hear .
you &apos;re just like him .
if you want , and you &apos;re going to be rots .
100 years are just a blink in the lives of a elves .
i have patience .
i can wait .
did he invent a trade ?
yeah .
i told him îsh kakhfê ai -- ' d dûr-rugnu !
he &apos;s on his opacity .
well , that &apos;s what you might do .
a trade was our only hope .
not our only hope .
i know you &apos;re here .
tell , why are you in the shadows ?
i wanted to report you .
did i have no bid to destroy this nest , less than two moons ?
we have the forest like bid purgee , my king .
they &apos;re breeding in the ruins of dolomite quicklime guldur .
we could kill them there .
this stronghold is beyond our limits .
keep these creatures away from our realm .
that &apos;s your job .
and if we built them up ? what ?
don &apos;t you move to other people ?
other states are not mine .
the fortunes of the world bring rise and doom .
but here , in this kingdom , we will outlive .
legolas said you fought well today .
he &apos;s very affectionate .
i assure you , my king , legolas doesn &apos;t look at me as the leader of the police station .
that might have been like this .
now i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
i don &apos;t think your son would allow your son to promise a simple waldelbe .
no , sure , i wouldn &apos;t .
and yet , he likes to .
don &apos;t make him hope where no .
the stone in your hand , what is that ?
a good luck charm .
a powerful magic is on that .
reads another one as a dwarf that runes , it &apos;s always cursed .
or not .
and if you think about that .
just a memory .
a runenstein .
my mother gave him to me so i think of my promise .
which promise ?
that i return to her .
she cares .
she &apos;s holding me for most reckless .
are you ?
no .
there &apos;s a big party up there , right up there .
it &apos;s mereth e-ngilith , the sternenlicht-fest .
the eldar is all sacred .
but most people love the light of the stars .
i always thought it &apos;s a cold light .
most inaccessible and far away .
it &apos;s memory , especially precious and pure .
like your promise .
i &apos;ve been there sometimes .
beyond the forest and up to the night .
i &apos;ve seen the world disappear , and the white light of the eternity is prepossessed .
i &apos;ve seen a feuermond .
he went on the passport at dunland .
huge .
red and golden , the whole sky leuchtete .
we eskortierten a group of business people from the ered luin .
they traded silberarbeiten against hides .
we took the grünweg to south , the mountains on our left .
and then he appeared .
this huge feuermond and illumed our way .
i wish i could show you the caves under these mountains .
galion , age chiseler , we have nothing to drink .
the empty drums should have sent back to esgaroth .
the bargee is certainly waiting .
that &apos;s what you have to do with our übellaunigen king : it understands what it is .
come on , elros , sampled .
i have to guard the dwarfs .
they &apos;re locked up .
where should you go ?
ha , ha .
i bet the sun is going on .
the day is certainly broken .
we will never reach the mountain , right ?
as long as you &apos;re sitting in here , certainly not .
bilbo !
what ?
psst! !
here they are all guardianship !
ha , ha , ha .
hold the doors .
that &apos;s how we win time .
all right , nori .
the staircase up .
you first .
original .
not that long .
here .
follow me .
power .
caution .
over here .
come on .
you don &apos;t have ' .
we &apos;re in the basement !
you should be rausführen and not even deeper .
i know what i do .
psst! !
here !
here !
go , everyone in the drums , quick .
are you crazy ?
then you find us .
no , no .
don &apos;t you , i promise it .

oh , you !
why am i here , gandalf ?
believe me , radagast .
i didn &apos;t have called you triftigen .
for a gathering , no nice place .
no , it &apos;s not .
these are dark spells , gandalf .
old and full of hate .
who is buried here ?
if he had a name , he &apos;s forgotten .
he &apos;s just known as a servant of evil .
one flock .
one from nine .
why now , gandalf ?
i don &apos;t realize that .
the ringgeister were called after dolomite quicklime guldur .
the necromancer can &apos;t be it .
a human conjuror could not augur such a freak .
who says something from human ?
the nine obey only one guy .
we were blind , radagast .
and in our blindness , the enemy comes back .
he calls his servant . why ?
azog according to which is not just a predator .
he &apos;s a leader .
he commands legionen .
the enemy is heading to war .
it &apos;s going to start in the east .
he &apos;s got it on this mountain .
where do you want to go ?
back to the other .
gandalf .
i started it .
i don &apos;t let them down .
they &apos;re in the biggest danger .
if it &apos;s true what you say , the whole world is in the biggest danger .
the power in that stronghold will be more powerful .
you verlangst that i leave my friends ?
is anything behind us ?
i see , not .
we have the orcs taken down .
not for long , no current .
bombur is half drowning victim .
all for the bank !
all right .
come on .
gloin , help me , brother .
come on , up with you .
go !
come on , you riesenklotz !
i &apos;m okay , it &apos;s nothing .
stand up .
kili is stricken .
his leg has to be connected .
a orkmeute follows us .
we need to continue .
and where ?
the mountain .
we are dense .
a lake is between us and the mountain .
we have nothing to cross it .
let &apos;s go around .
then we get the orcs to track . cocksure .
we have no guns to defend us .
connect his leg , fast .
you have two minutes .
do that again , and you &apos;re dead .
sorry , but you &apos;re probably out of the maritime city when i &apos;m not mad .
that kahn that you have there wouldn &apos;t be any time to rent ?
how do you think i would help you ?
your boots have seen better days .
it &apos;s like your coat .
and no doubt you have to astringent astringent astringent .
how many brats ?
a boy and two girls .
and your wife , i think , is a beauty .
yeah .
that was her .
condones .
it wasn &apos;t my intention .
oh , come on , stop .
end with the civilities .
why so a hurry ?
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;d like to know who you are . and what verschlägt you in this area .
we &apos;re very simple from the blue mountains , traveling to our relatives in the eisenbergen .
simple business people , do you say ?
we need food , supplies , weapons .
can you help us ?
i know where these drums come from .
and if .
i don &apos;t know what you did with the elves . well , it &apos;s not gone out .
you need the permission of the bürgermeisters to get into the maritime city .
its whole wealth comes from trade to the waldland-reich .
he put you in a chain rather than that he alarm tone the anger .
offer it more .
i bet in the city , you kind of get unseen .
yeah .
but for that , she bräuchtet a bootlegger .
and we pay twice that .
that &apos;s the nature of evil .
out there , in allgegenwärtiger ignorance , schwärt it and spreads .
a shadow growing in the dark .
a schlaflose cattiness , as black as the aufziehende of the night .
that &apos;s how it happened .
it will always be .
over time , all the corruption comes from .
you &apos;ve followed a community of 13 dwarf-sized .
why ?
no 13th .
no longer .
the boy , the schwarzhaarige bowman , our morgulpfeil hit .
the toxin is in his blood .
and soon he smothered .
answer the question , beast .
i would rather be disgruntling .
you like , orcs ?
you like death ?
then i want to give it to you .
a dead dwarf is indifferent to me .
answer the question .
you have nothing to worry .
tell us what you know , and i &apos;m going to release you .
she did the command to kill her .
why ?
what &apos;s going on to you ?
this mickrige dwarf will never be king .
king ?
there &apos;s no king under the mountains , and there will never be one .
nobody cares to go to the erebor , as long as the dragon lives .
you don &apos;t know .
your world will burn .
what are you talking about ?
talk !
our time begins to new .
my commander serves one .
do you begreifst ?
the death is before .
the flames of the war are before .
why did you do that ?
you promised him to free him .
i did .
i &apos;ve liberated his fictional shoulders from his erbärmlichen skull .
this orcs could have told us more .
i couldn &apos;t have said to him anymore .
what did he mean with flames of the war ?
it means you &apos;re going to release a power that &apos;s so powerful that it &apos;s all in your way .
the guards doubled our limitations !
all the rivers , all the rivers .
nothing happens without knowing that i know it .
nobody gets into that kingdom .
and nobody leaves it .
caution !
i was born at this use of water , and i was grown up .
i wanted to drown you , i wouldn &apos;t do it here .
oh , this vorlaute seemensch .
i say we throw it over , then calm .
oh , cash dividend . the man is called cash dividend .
how do you know ?
ah , i asked him .
i don &apos;t care how it is .
i can &apos;t suffer .
we don &apos;t have to suffer it .
we just have to pay it .
come on , guys .
krempelt your bags .
how do we know that he doesn &apos;t hoodwinks us ?
not .
we &apos;re missing 10 coins .
gloin .
come on .
give us what you have .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
this journey has completely bleeding to death me .
and what did i get for my disbursement ?
nothing as grief and misery and ... ...
in my barter .
take it .
grab everything .
um .
money , quick .
we &apos;ll only pay you if we have our supplies .
if the freedom is dear to you , you do what i say .
there we go .
what does he do ?
he &apos;s talking to someone .
now he &apos;s looking at us directly .
now you &apos;ll give yourself your hand .
what ?
back-stabber .
he wants to deliver us .
quiet now .
we come to the zolltor .
stop !
merchandise control !
papers , please .
oh , you &apos;re , cash dividend .
tomorrow , peredur .
have you a sign ?
nothing , i &apos;m just frozen over and tired and wants to go home .
it &apos;s like me .
please .
all right .
not so rashest .
consignment of empty fässern from the waldland-reich .
they &apos;re not empty , is it ' , cash dividend ?
if i &apos;m quite entsinne , you &apos;ve been approved as a bargee .
and not as fishermen .
you can &apos;t do that .
error .
and the mayor goes to something , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
oh , come on , alfrid , have a heart .
people have to eat .
this fish is not authorized .
tilting table the drums .
above .
you &apos;ve heard ' .
in the channel with it .
power .
hurry you .
the people of the city are suffering .
the times is heavy .
food is scarce .
that &apos;s not my problem .
stop .
always fürstreiter people , what , cash dividend ?
the buckler of the little people .
you still have your support , bargee , but not a long time .
opens the door !
the mayor has an eye on you .
you &apos;d rather notice that .
we know where you live .
it &apos;s a small city , alfrid .
everybody knows where he lives .
the whole talk of inner riots .
somebody pokes the fire , bless .
do you make the gicht , sir ?
that &apos;s the moisture , what else ?
get a fire-water .
people &apos;s mood , lord , gets most rebellious .
the secret people , alfrid , was always most rebellious .
what can i do for you to live in a place that insulted blubber and tar ?
work , house , food .
same day the same . bleating and bitching .
i think you &apos;re going to be by unruhestiftern revolutionised , sir .
mayor : then we have to find the agitator and box .
i also see that , gentleman .
and this talk of change has to be prevented .
i can &apos;t afford to have the canaille zusammentut and aufmuckt .
the next thing they &apos;re going to do is they start asking , gather together , gathering research .
continuing with the old one , with the new one .
what ?
that &apos;s what everybody says , ok .
some rumor even from elections .
election ?
that &apos;s absurd .
as if i would allow that .
i think that after that , no one would ask .
bludger .
undankbares pack .
demagogue .
who would be so every three hours , anzuzweifeln my authority ?
who would car ?
who ...
cash dividend .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure .
this agitator is a bargee .
take your hands away .
you didn &apos;t see them .
they were never here .
you can have fish for free .
follow me .
dad !
our house , it &apos;s observed .
tell the mayor that i &apos;m done today .
dad !
where were you ?
dad !
there you are !
i was so worried .
here , sigrid .
bain , get in .
if you tell anyone , i &apos;ll get both arms .
finger away .
up .
dad , why are they coming from our closet ?
will they get us lucky ?
you may not quite fit , but you keep warm .
thank you . thank you .
a zwergen-windlanze .
have you seen a mind ?
that &apos;s what he has .
the last time we saw a weapon was a city in flames .
it was the day where the dragon was coming .
the day it destroyed valley valley .
girion , the prince of valley , let his bogenschützen shoot on the steals from .
but a dragonhide pelt is thick .
bigger than the strongest armor .
just a black arrow , shot off a windlanze , can penetrate the skin of the dragon .
and very few of those arrows have ever been the fake .
and the supply of the supply was the last trial .
if he didn &apos;t end his goal , a lot would have come .
sounds like it &apos;s been would be .
all the dwarfs know the story .
then she wüsstet that girion had hit the dragon .
he solved a flake under the left wing .
another arrow , and he would have killed the steals from .
this is a fairy tales for children , little .
nothing on .
you took our money .
where are the weapons ?
wait here .
tomorrow the last autumn days start .
and the durinstag is already overmorrow .
we have to reach the mountain before .
and if we can &apos;t do it ?
what if we haven &apos;t found the secret door until then ?
then the whole path was free .
what should that be ?
a spießhaken .
made from an old harpoon .
here ?
a krähenschnabel , we call it this .
from a forging hammer .
it &apos;s hard to be in hand , granted , but to defense of life , it &apos;s really better than nothing .
we paid you for guns .
from iron geschmiedete swords and axes !
this is a joke !
you can &apos;t find anything better outside of the city .
all the geschmiedeten weapons are closing or shutting device there .
thorin , let &apos;s take what &apos;s there and go .
i &apos;m already with less managed-with , and you do .
i say we break up .
you go nowhere .
what did you say ?
spies watch the house , and probably every fluted land and protection of investors in the city .
you have to wait until it gets dark .
thorin .
dad ?
don &apos;t go away .
tauriel , you can &apos;t hunt 30 orcs alone .
i &apos;m not alone .
you know , i would come .
the king is indignant , tauriel .
for 600 years , my father will be protecting you .
and you don &apos;t befolgst your commands .
missachtest are trust .
the king has never approved that orcs are going through our country .
but now he lets them kill the border and our prisoners .
that &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s our fight .
this is not going to end .
with each victory , evil becomes stronger .
when it comes to your dad , we don &apos;t do anything .
we hide behind walls , and a life goes away from the light , and we leave the darkness .
are we not part of the world ?
tell me , 18,000 .
when did we think that evil is becoming stronger than us ?
well , cash dividend .
what do you seek ?
here was a wall hanging !
an age !
where is he ?
what wall hanging do you mean ?
this one .
these were dwarfs , i tell you .
they came out of nowhere .
chaos beards , wild eyes .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve never seen .
what have dwarfs to look for in our area ?
that &apos;s the prophecy .
encouraging ?
the forecast of durins people .
the prophecy .
prophecy .
the old stories are true .
massive halls of estimation .
can that be true ?
is the lord of the silberquellen come back ?
the lord of the silberquellen
the king edlen stone columns
the king under the mountains .
take a look , what is his !
so , happy .
if the king of the king
reemergence reemergence reemergence
but all of this goes .
and the lake is going to be a gout of flame .
dad , i tried to stop them !
how long are they going to continue ?
see what ?
not that loud .
once we have the weapons , we &apos;re going to break up to the mountain .
go ahead , go ahead .
go , nori .
next .
will it go ?
i can do that .
let &apos;s go fast .
run !
quick now !
finger away !
bring it over here .
make them legs !
what is this agitation ?
we caught them when they wanted to steal weapons , lord .
so treasonous , huh ?
just a kümmerlicher pile when you ask me , lord .
hold your tongue !
you don &apos;t know who to do it with .
that &apos;s not any ned .
this is thorin , son of thrain , son of thror !
we are the dwarfs erebors .
and we &apos;ve come to our home .
i remember this town in the old times .
all of handelsflotten were in harbor , filled with silk and edelsteinen .
this was not a vergessene city on a lake .
this was the center of jedweden trade in the north .
i get this time back .
we enkindle the great background of the dwarfs , that prosperity and prosperity wiederergießen , from the halls .
death !
that will bring you to us .
drachenfeuer and addling !
if you hold your steals from , you will all annihilating us .
you can hear on these alarmist , but i promise you .
if you can do it , all of you will get involved in the abundance of the mountain .
then you have enough gold to build esgaroth 10 times .
you all !
listen to me !
you have to listen .
have you forgotten what happened to valley ?
have you forgotten your life in the conflagration ?
and what do all this mean ?
for a bergkönigs ambition , so eroding of greed , he only has his own advantage .
please , please !
we can , and that &apos;s true for all of us , not accuse .
and let &apos;s not forget : it was girion , the prince of valley .
yes , mr. .
we all know the story .
arrow around arrow has shot .
each verfehlte is his goal .
you &apos;re not right .
no right to enter this mountain .
i &apos;ve got that right .
i &apos;m talking to the mayor of maritime city .
do you want the prediction to be accomplished ?
do you want to participate in the great wealth of our people ?
what do you tell ?
i say to you ...
welcome !
welcome !
and 3-mal welcome , king under the mountains !
by the way , we &apos;re too little .
where is bofur ?
if it &apos;s not here , let &apos;s leave it back .
that &apos;s what we need to do when we want to find the door in front of the night .
we can &apos;t lose time anymore .
you don &apos;t .
we need to be a hurry .
you would stop us .
it also has to deal with it .
what do you talk about , of course , with me .
no .
i &apos;m going to be there when that door comes up .
when we first see the halls of our fathers , thorin .
kili . stay here .
shut out .
come on when you &apos;re healthy .
i &apos;m staying with boys .
the transportation of injured persons are my duty .
uncle .
we grew up with stories on the mountain .
you told them .
you can tell him that .
don &apos;t take away !
filicide .
i wear him if it must be .
one day you will be king and understand .
i can &apos;t put the fate of this project for a dwarf .
not for my nephews .
filicide , don &apos;t be a goop .
you gehörst to the community .
i &apos;m one of my brother .
in my barter , it &apos;s so late ?
ah !
so now , we break up with our goodwill and best wish .
and please your return ...
wait !
... happiness .
goodbye !
out of the way !
no !
ha .
did you miss the boat ?
kili ?
kili !
no .
from dwarf-sized i have enough .
disappears !
no , no , no !
please !
nobody wants to help us .
kili is sick .
very sick .
what is this place ?
once again , this was the city valley .
it &apos;s a ruin now .
it &apos;s just smaugs waste .
the sun is soon reaching their zenith .
we have to find the secret door in the mountain before it stops .
along here .
wait !
is this the aussichtsposten ?
gandalf said we should meet here .
no , no , we should ...
do you see him ?
we can &apos;t wait for the magician .
we &apos;ve been asking ourselves .
come on !
dolomite quicklime guldur .
the barrow of magic .
it looks completely outside .
it &apos;s intentional .
a whammy camouflages of this place , which means our enemy is not ready to show themselves .
he hasn &apos;t got his full strength yet .
radagast , presentation a message to ms. galadriel .
tell us , we need to force it to act .
how do you mean that ?
i go alone .
and in no case , you can follow me .
do i have your word ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah !
wait , gandalf !
maybe that &apos;s a trap !
go and don &apos;t come back !
it &apos;s certainly a trap .
see what ?
nothing !
if the map is true , the secret door is right over us .
up here !
you have sharp eyes , bilbo baggins .
this must be her .
the secret door .
should all of you regret that day , regret .
so then .
we have a key thing .
that means there &apos;s also a keyhole .
the last beam in the durinstag is going to be on the keyhole .
nori .
the light wanes .
power .
silence !
i don &apos;t hear anything if you &apos;re talking about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s not here !
it &apos;s not here !
pushbutton it .
yes !
go ahead .
wick !
it has to break !
that &apos;s nothing .
the door is sealed .
you don &apos;t come with violence .
a powerful magic is on that .
no !
... your last beam on the durinstag drop down is on the keyhole .
this is what it says .
what have we missed ?
what have we missed ?
balin ?
the light is continued .
we can &apos;t do anything more .
we just had this one attempt .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s over .
wait a minute . threw ...
we were too late .
where do they want to go ?
you won &apos;t give up to people .
thorin .
you can &apos;t give up .
imagine the gray rock when the throttles hits .
the untergehende sun lets its last beam of durinstag .
the last beam .
the last beam .
the last beam !
the keyhole !
come back !
come back !
it &apos;s the light of the moon .
the last herbstmondes !
ha , ha , ha .
where is the key ?
where is it ?
he was here .
oh , he was ...
he was there .
he was still there ...
erebor .
thorin .
i know these walls .
these halls .
this stone .
do you remember , balin ?
chambers filled with goldenem light .
i remember .
there &apos;s the seventh kingdom , home by durins people .
may the heart of the mountain combine all the dwarfs to defend this home .
the royal throne .
ah .
and what about that ?
the arkenstein .
the arkenstein .
and what is that ?
that &apos;s the reason why you &apos;re here .
can you do nothing at all ?
i need herbs .
something to lower his fever .
i have night owl .
i have hundskamille .
they don &apos;t use me .
don &apos;t you have a königskraut ?
no , that &apos;s weed control .
so we feed the pigs .
pigs ?
weed control .
exactly .
don &apos;t get off the spot .
you want me to find a gem ?
a big white gem .
yeah .
that &apos;s all ?
there &apos;s certainly a lot down there .
there &apos;s only one arkenstein . and you &apos;ll see it when you see it .
ah .
the truth is , boy , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to find down there .
you don &apos;t have to go if you don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s not dishonorableness , umzukehren .
no , balin .
i promised i would do it , and i think i should try .
it always astonished me .
what ?
the guts of hobbits .
now , with all of the happiness you can express .
respect ?
if you were to actually be a living kite down there , don &apos;t buzzer it .
where is your gentleman ?
where is he ?
sauron !
hello ?
it &apos;s not home .
not home .
um .
good .
all right , good , good .
what is that ?
psst! . psst! .
arkenstein .
arkenstein .
a big white gem .
very helpful .
so , you know ?
burglar , i can smell you .
i can hear your breath .
i feel you &apos;re here .
where are you ?
where are you ?
come . not so shy .
come on the light .
yeah .
there &apos;s something about you .
something you wear with you .
something from gold .
but it &apos;s a much greater treasure .
darling !
darling !
ah , there you go , burglar , wandelt .
i didn &apos;t intend to steal from you . oh , you get extraordinary richer .
i just wanted to affirm your glory .
to see if you &apos;re really as big as the old stories tell .
i didn &apos;t believe it .
now do you think it ?
in fact , all songs and they &apos;re going to stay far behind your atrociousness . oh , you &apos;re unermesslicher .
do you think blandishments will save your life ?
no , no .
no , indeed .
my name seems to be aware of you , but i can &apos;t entsinnen myself , like you &apos;d smell .
who are you ? and where do you come from when i get asked ?
i come from the hill .
under the hill ?
yeah , and my journey also led me to under the mountain and bleary-eyed mountain .
and ...
and the skies also .
i &apos;m the wandelnde invisible .
impressive .
what else would you like to be ?
i &apos;m a ...
glück-glücksbringer .
rätsel-rätsellöser .
dearest , that title .
go ahead .
fassreiter .
drums ?
that &apos;s interesting .
and what about your little zwergenfreunden ?
where do they hide ?
zwergenfreunde ?
no .
no .
no , dwarfs are not here .
you have misunderstood .
oh , i don &apos;t think fassreiter !
they sent you to leave the dangerous work , while they &apos;re out there .
in fact , you are mistaken , oh , smaug , you ehrwürdigste and entsetzlichste of all disasters .
you have good bearing for a celebration and a liar !
i know the smell and the taste of dwarf-sized .
i don &apos;t know anything better !
it &apos;s the gold .
they &apos;re attracted by estimate like flies from totem meat .
do you think i didn &apos;t know that day ?
that a mob more dissembling dwarfs comes to the mountain ?
was that an earthquake ?
that , my boy , was a kite .
dad ?
this is from the mountain .
you should disappear .
take your kids .
continues from here .
and where ?
we can nowhere .
will we die , dad ?
no , darling .
the dragon .
he will kill us all .
not when i first kill him .
the king under the mountains is dead .
i took his were enthroned , and i was sick of his people , like a wolf under sheep .
i &apos;ll kill where i want , and when i want to .
my tank is like iron .
no blade can penetrate me .
all right , further .
a black arrow ?
why have you never told me ?
because you don &apos;t know it .
now i &apos;m happy to listen .
you have to abstract the guards .
as soon as i &apos;m up on the tower , i put the arrow in the bow .
there he is !
cash dividend !
there we go ! go !
grabs him !
fast ! go down there .
run !
hold him !
hold him !
stop !
bain !
bain .
hiding it good .
nobody can find it .
i &apos;m going to finish with them .
i &apos;m not going to leave you alone .
now , go !
braga .
you &apos;re under bullpen .
what do you do ?
all the mayor is acceptable .
where is he .
where does it leave ?
we still leave him .
time ? what ?
to get killed ?
you fürchtest .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid .
i fear you .
this honey is suspended by a disease .
she pushed your grandfather up into madness .
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
you &apos;re not yourself .
the thorin i know would not be dilatoriness , go in ...
i don &apos;t chancing this activity for the life of a thief-proof .
bilbo .
his name is bilbo .
it &apos;s eichenschild . it &apos;s dwarf and usurper of the throne .
he sent you . he wants the arkenstein , right ?
no .
no , no . i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t effort it .
i &apos;ve had his bad intention a long time ago .
but that &apos;s meaningless .
eichenschilds activity is going to fail .
the darkness breaks in .
it passes in every corner of the country .
burglar , put it in the shadow . you &apos;re nothing more than a means for purpose .
the geneticists eichenschild the value of their life , and it affected it as a drossiness .
no .
no .
no , you lie .
what &apos;s he promised you ?
a percentage of the treasure ?
he would belong to him .
i &apos;m not going to separate from a single coin .
no one piece of it .
my teeth are crossed swords mark .
my claws are spears .
my wings is a hurricane !
so it &apos;s true .
the black arrow has found its goal .

the last of our clan .
they have to come from , because they had hope where there was no more .
we could try to reach the mines .

cowering .
breath for breath .

the winter is before .
we need to care about it .

we &apos;re just coming .
i tried to talk to him , but he doesn &apos;t hear .
what do you mean , boy ?
thorin !
thorin .
thorin .
he &apos;s down there for days .
he doesn &apos;t sleep .
he &apos;s not eating anything else .
he &apos;s no longer him .
not at least .
it &apos;s in this place .
a disease seems to be on it .
disease ?
what a disease ?
filicide .
filicide !
filicide !
gold .
gold beyond all the idea .
beyond grief and affliction .
look at it , the powerful treasure of thror .
welcome my schwestersöhne . the kingdom erebor .
balin !
kili !
thank you , you live !
bombur !
you live .
do you have anything ?
nothing else .
here &apos;s nothing .
go on .
this stone could be everywhere .
the arkenstein is in these halls .
find him !
you &apos;ve heard ' .
go on .
you all !
nobody lies until it &apos;s found .
it clucks me almost to leave him .
and it &apos;s just to see how eichenschild suffers .
see how it destroyed it .
see how it sense of being its heart , and it drives it into madness .
i help you .
just take the nötigste .
we have a long march ahead .
where do you go ?
there &apos;s only one place .
the mountain .
you &apos;re big , bless .
we can search in the mountain .
maybe smell something for dragon , but the women clean up .
there we have safe , warm and dry , and we have supplies . beds , clothing and a little gold .
the gold in this mountain is cursed .
we just take what we promised .
what we need for our new lives .
here .
let &apos;s do something .
the message of smaugs death will quickly spread .
yeah .
others will look at their way to the mountain , because of its wealth , and its location .
what do you know ?
nothing .
i &apos;m afraid what happens .
waldland-elben !
the prince and the elbenweib are followed by maritime city .
you &apos;ve seen something out there .
the orcs i &apos;ve been following in the maritime city , i know who he is .
bolg , a step of azog , the defiler .
a warg-meute on the edge of esgaroths was waiting for him .
they fled the north .
these orcs were different .
you put a sign that i haven &apos;t seen for a long time .
the sign gundabads .
gundabad ?
a ork-festung , up in the north of the nebelgebirges .
my lord legolas .
then my father , where no place is for tauriel , is no place for me .
legolas .
it &apos;s your king command .
yes , he &apos;s my king , but he didn &apos;t gebietet about my heart .
i go north . do you come to me ?
where ?
after gundabad .
the sterblichen , 24 / 7 .
i &apos;m not alone .
does her help , woman galadriel ?
you should have stayed dead .
mithrandir , come back .
he &apos;s here .
yeah .
the dark is back .
gandalf !
gandalf !
get up !
it &apos;s weak .
he &apos;s not allowed to stay here .
it zehrt his life .
flees !
fast !
comes with me , woman galadriel .
flees !
you don &apos;t have a power here , servant by morgoth .
you &apos;re anonymity .
grayness .
shapelessness .
back into the emptiness that you came back from !
the mind has survived .
but it was displaced .
it &apos;s going to escape . in the east .
gondor must be warning .
they have to wake up on the borders .
no .
care about mistress galadriel .
it &apos;s used a lot of its power .
their strength wanes .
bring it to lothlórien .
my lord saruman .
he &apos;s got to go to the track and get wiped out for everyone .
without the ring of power , sauron can never again reach the rule of mittelerde .
all right .
überlasst sauron me .
i need a horse .
what ?
gandalf .
where do you want to go ?
erebor .
you don &apos;t know what to do .
i saw her with her eyes . row around row . moria-orks .
versammle our friends . birds and animals .
the battle around the mountain is going to start soon .
he &apos;s here in these halls .
i know it .
we have all searched .
not so hard enough .
thorin , we all wish we &apos;d take the rock back .
and yet he &apos;s not found !
do you zweifelst at the addictedness of any one here ?
the arkenstein is the birthright of our people .
he &apos;s the königsjuwel .
am i not the king ?
notice you .
should somebody find him and miss him .
meet my revenge .
drachenkrankheit .
i &apos;ve seen that .
this view .
the terrible desire .
it &apos;s a wild and neidvolle love , bilbo .
she pushed his grandfather into the craze .
balin , if thorin had the arkenstein , if ... if he found ...
this rock is the genesis of everything .
he &apos;s the pinnacle of all wealth here , and gives them a force that &apos;s carrying it .
would he make his madness deliriousness imperious ?
no , my boy .
i fear it would be worse .
maybe it &apos;s better , it &apos;s lost .
what is that ?
in your hand .
that &apos;s nothing .
show me ' .
it ...
i put them in beorns garden .
you brought them to this ?
i plant them in my backyard .
in beutelsend .
a fairly small memory for the meadow landscape .
it becomes a tree .
and if i look at it , i &apos;ll remember .
on everything that &apos;s happened , the good thing , the evil , and fortunately to have it home .
thorin , i ...
thorin .
survivors of maritime city . they &apos;re course into valley .
to hundreds .
call everyone to the gate .
the door !
immediately !
come on .
go on .
lord !
lord !
here !
see , mr. !
the feuerschalen burn .
so thorin eichenschild and his accompaniment survived .
survive ?
you mean , there &apos;s a bunch of dwarfs on all the gold ?
don &apos;t worry , alfrid .
in the mountain , there &apos;s enough gold for everyone .
here &apos;s the bivouac .
get a shelter .
and make some fire .
so , you hurry . you go .
alfrid .
her übernehmt übernehmt .
up with that !
all right .
i &apos;d like to knit the stronghold to sunrise .
conquer the mountain was hard .
i don &apos;t even leave him again .
the maritime city people have nothing more .
they come to us .
all they had was lost .
don &apos;t tell me what you lost .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with me .
the drachenfeuer have survived , should be happy .
they have all the reason to be grateful .
more stones .
get more rocks to gateway !
we would have that .
these kids are hungry .
we need what to eat .
we don &apos;t think about three days .
cash dividend .
we don &apos;t have enough .
what you can do , peredur .
everything gets good .
don &apos;t worry .
we need more water .
children , hurt and women go .
here . drinkable water .
good morning , alfrid .
anything happened at night ?
all right , lord .
nothing happens .
don &apos;t miss me .
except an army of elves , like me .
my lord thranduil . we have you here .
not expected .
i heard you need help .
here , take it !
keep it going !
one more !
you &apos;ve saved us .
i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
your gratitude is unnecessary .
i &apos;m not about you here .
i &apos;m going to come up with something that belongs to me .
and in this mountain , there are gems , which i conation .
white stones from pure light .
the white stones from lasgalen .
i know a elbenfürsten that would pay a proud price for it .
wait !
please , wait !
you go to war because of a handful of gems ?
the erbstücke of my people won &apos;t give up .
we have the same goal .
my people also have a claim to the opulences in this mountain .
let me talk about thorin .
you want to negotiate with the dwarf ?
to prevent a war ?
yeah .
not a bad job for a night .
come on .
are greeted , thorin , son of thrain .
that you &apos;re alive , we don &apos;t hope to hope .
why are you in kriegsrüstung on the gate of the king under the mountains ?
why are the king under the mountains like a predator in the cave ?
maybe because i expect to be robbed .
my lord to paste you is not here . just to get a simple kind of reasoning .
don &apos;t you want to talk to me ?
i hear .
in the name of the maritime city , i &apos;m telling you to keep your word .
a fraction of the treasure so you can retranslation your life .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with anybody as long as an army in front of my gate .
this army in weapons will attack the mountain if we won &apos;t agree .
your threats don &apos;t impress me .
and yours ?
does it not tell you that our cause is legally ?
my people helped you .
and , thanks to that , you don &apos;t have to get them down to addling and death .
when have the people ever helped themselves to be rewarded without the rich ?
we have a bargain .
a deal ?
what could we do when our birthright to barter away and food ?
as our freedom to buy with our future ?
that &apos;s called a gerechten trade ?
tell me , &quot; tell me .
cash dividend , the dragon slayer , why would i recognize these rules ?
because you gave us your word .
does it mean nothing ?
disappears !
before our arrows fly !
what do you do ?
you can &apos;t run war .
you can &apos;t do that .
sorry , but if you haven &apos;t noticed it , a elbenheer is down there before the gate .
just to mention hundreds of zorniger fishermen .
we &apos;re clearly in the unterzahl .
no longer very long .
what does that mean ?
that means master baggins , you should never underestimate dwarfs .
we have the erebor back .
and now we defend him .
he &apos;s going to give us nothing .
a bitchiness .
after all , after all , after all .
you &apos;ve tried .
i don &apos;t understand .
why ?
why is he embracing a war ?
to negotiate with them is idle .
they only understand one .
we reach on sunrise .
are you at our side ?
yeah .
champion baggins , come here .
that could be useful .
put it on .
this shirt was forged by silberstahl .
mithril , it &apos;s called my ancestors .
no blade can penetrate it .
i look ridiculous .
i &apos;m not a warrior , i &apos;m a hobbit .
it &apos;s a gift .
a sign of our friendship .
real friends are rarely found .
i was blind , but now i see again .
you have told me .
tell ?
the arkenstein .
one of them stole him .
one of them is a artificer of fraud .
thorin ... the task is full . you &apos;ve got the mountain back .
isn &apos;t that enough ?
you know , from my own people .
no , um -- you gave the people a promise to people .
is this treasure more value than your honor ?
our honor , our honor .
i was there .
i &apos;ve given my word .
and i &apos;m grateful for that .
but the treasure in this mountain is not the people from the maritime city .
this is the gold .
we are alone .
in my life , i &apos;m not going to be a single one .
separate coin .
no one &apos;s even that little piece of it .
gundabad .
what &apos;s it about ?
an old enemy .
the past kingdom angmar .
this stronghold once was the bastion .
this was their big armories .
her articles of war was forged .
a light .
something has moved .
we &apos;re waiting for protecting the night .
this is a evil place , tauriel .
in another age , our people led war on this land .
my mother died there .
my father doesn &apos;t talk about it .
there is no grave .
no memory .
nothing .
ah !
let me go through !
out of the way !
no , no .
no !
hey !
you !
cusp cap !
yeah .
we don &apos;t want layabout , beggar , even rovers .
we also have without people like you yourself enough .
with you .
get on your nag .
who has this saying ?
who wants to know ?
you must have your kleinlichen conflict with the dwarf-sized attach .
there will be war !
the cesspools dolomite quicklime guldurs exploded .
you &apos;re all in deadly danger .
what do you talk about ?
i see you don &apos;t know anything about zauberern .
they &apos;re like a wintergewitter that heranrollt on a rasenden wind , then convey bad customers .
but sometimes a storm is just a storm .
not that time .
ork-heere back .
they are fighter .
they were grown for war .
our enemy has gathered all its forces .
now why should he show up ?
because we have forced him .
back then , as thorin eichenschild aufbrach to bring back his home .
the dwarfs should never reach the erebor .
azog was sent to kill her .
his lord wants to bring the mountain into his violence .
it &apos;s not just because of the schatzes , but its strategic position .
this is the gateway to the rückeroberung of the country in north america .
now , this dark kingdom goes again , bruchtal , lórien , the meadow landscape , even gondor be destroyed .
these ork-heere that you &apos;re talking about , mithrandir , where are you ?
this fools .
if we hineinwollen , we should go now .
these bats are being grown into a cause .
what ?
for war .
when is my advice going to be so geringgeschätzt ?
what do you think i &apos;m talking about ?
i think you want to save your zwergenfreunde , and i will admiration your allegiance to you .
but it doesn &apos;t take me off , from my course .
you &apos;ve begun , mithrandir .
condones me when i close it .
are the bogenschützen in the corner ?
yeah , sir .
gave .
if anything on this mountain comes , it kills .
the time of dwarfs is around .
you go ! bowman !
are you okay with that ?
is gold so important to you ?
do you purchased it with the blood of dwarf-sized ?
it won &apos;t come .
that struggle you can &apos;t win .
it won &apos;t stop it .
do you think the dwarfs are coming up ?
never .
they &apos;re fighting to death for their cause .
bilbo baggins .
if i don &apos;t fake myself , this is the halflin halfling , which has stolen the key to my verliesen in front of my guards .
yeah .
please excuse me .
i &apos;ve come to give you this .
the heart of the mountain .
the königsjuwel .
and royal shutter lag &apos;s worth .
how does it come to its property ?
this is my fourteenths share of the treasure .
why do you do that ?
they don &apos;t owes us .
i don &apos;t do that for you .
i know dwarfs can be pigheadedness and bullheaded and difficult .
most distrustful and secretive and the worst bearing that you can imagine , but they &apos;re also bravest and most kindly and infinitely true .
i closed her in the heart , and i want to save her if i can .
thorin is more value than anything else .
in order to tell him , he &apos;ll certainly give you what he owes you .
so there &apos;s no reason for war .
hang on tonight .
you have to break tomorrow .
what ?
go from here as far as possible .
i &apos;m not going to go .
you &apos;ve made me go to the fourteenthly man .
i &apos;m not going to leave the business .
there &apos;s no activity .
no longer .
not come from what thorin does when he experiences this .
i &apos;m not afraid of thorin .
you should .
never underestimating evil in the gold .
you know , gold , on which one feuer-schlange at odd times .
the drachenkrankheit goes into the hearts of everybody who gets close to the mountain .
almost everybody .
ha .
you do .
so this hobbit is looking at a bed and filling his stomach with warmem food .
he deserves it .
hey .
behaltet him in the eye .
if it wants to disappear , it tells me .
you go .
stupid hobbit .
up , up , hobbit !
out of the feathers !
next , you hit your eyes .
we come to tell you that the acquittance of your blame is offered and adopted .
what acquittance ?
i &apos;ve given you nothing .
you have nothing .
we have this .
they have the arkenstein .
filchers !
how does the heirloom of our house come into your hands ?
this stone belongs to the king !
and the king should get him . with our goodwill .
but first , he has to stand to his word .
they want to be fooled .
this is just a artifice .
a dirty lie .
the arkenstein is hidden in this mountain !
this is a deception .
no , that &apos;s not a deception .
the stone is real .
i gave him .
you ?
i took him as my fourteenthly part .
you stole him ?
stolen ?
no .

i &apos;m ready to get rid of my demands .

your demands .
you don &apos;t have any claims to me , you &apos;re lousy .
i wanted to give him .
many times i wanted it , but ...
but what do you fry ?
you changed you , thorin .
the dwarf i met in beutelsend would have never broken his word .
never would have the allegiance of his gezweifelt .
you &apos;re not talking to me about allegiance .
shipyard gates it down wall !
don &apos;t you hear me ?
then i do it myself .

noa shalt be , and the wizard .
that &apos;s got us forced .
if you &apos;re not satisfied with my master thief , please do nothing .

oh , but not yet , prince dain .
gandalf of gray .
say this lowlifes , it &apos;s supposed to disappear , otherwise i &apos;m going to get the floor with your blood .
a war between dwarf-sized , people and elves is unnecessary .
an army from orcs march to the mountain .
hold your strength back .
i don &apos;t think so much back .
and not before that ehrlosen waldland-kobold .
he only wants the worst to my people .
and he should ask me between me and my clan .

thorin ... they die out there .
there are halls around that mountain .
places that we attach can enhance , secure .
yeah . yeah . that &apos;s it .
we have to lower the gold below the earth .
convey .
did you hear ?
dain is cornered .
they become butchered .
many die in war .
life is worthless .
but a treasure like this doesn &apos;t balance out into lost life .
it &apos;s worth it . it &apos;s worth all of the blood that we spill .
you &apos;re sitting here in these enormous halls , and you wear a starry crown , but you &apos;re better than you &apos;ve ever been .
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m any lesser zwergenfürst . i &apos;m still ...
thorin thorin thorin
eichenschild .
i &apos;m your king !
you were always my king .
and you used to know that .
you don &apos;t see what &apos;s gotten out of you .
go .
disappearance .
before i annihilate you .
you sit here and you wear a crown on your head .
you &apos;re better than you &apos;ve ever been .
a treasure , like this , doesn &apos;t balance out with a lost life .
this honey is suspended by a disease .
it &apos;s a blind ambition .
am i not the king ?
this is the gold .
let &apos;s do it . ourselves .
i &apos;m not going to separate from a single coin .
he &apos;s only got his own advantage in mind .
as if i had some lesser zwergenfürst .
thorin eichenschild .
she pushed your grandfather up into madness .
this is thorin , son of thrain , son of thror .

is this treasure more value than your honor ?
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
the honey will be your death !
retreat !
retreat ! to the mountain !
retreat !
now comes your end .
i &apos;m not going to hide behind a wall of rock while others go to battle .
this is not in my blood , thorin .
no .
truly not .
we are durins durins .
and durins people don &apos;t fight any fight .
i don &apos;t have a right to ask that from you .
but do you want to follow me ? one last time ?
thorin .
for the king !
for the king !
the dwarfs .
they go to fight .
on the side of her king .
every man who &apos;s willing to give everything , follow me !
we are facing our men in life , so in death .
i come .
armed you .
come on with us , gammer .
no , no , no .
-- let me get old broad in peace .
no fear .
i said , let me !
alfrid leckspuckel .

i don &apos;t think so .
filicide ... take your brother .

what does that mean ?
they &apos;re mortal .
you hold your life more value than your life , although there &apos;s no love in it .
there &apos;s no love in you .
what do you know about love ?
nothing .
what you &apos;re doing for this dwarf is not real .
