the world is changing .
i feel it in the water .
i feel it in the world .
i smell it in the air .
a lot of what once was , is lost because nobody lives more , who remembers .
it started with the back of the big rings .
three were given the elben , the immortal , weisesten and reinsten of all creatures .
seven den , big bergleuten and handwerkern in their halls of rock .
and nine -- nine rings were given to people who were striving in particular .
because these rings bargen the force and the will to lead every people .
but they all cheated .
because a ring was made .
in mordor , in the feuer of the schicksalsberges schmiedete of the dark herrscher sauron , the dark herrscher sauron heimlich a meisterring to beherrschen everyone else .
in this ring , his cruelty , his bosheit and his will , went to unterdrücken all life .
a ring to knechten them .
the row came out of the freien countries under the herrschaft of the ringes .
some made resistance .
one last bündnis of people and elben moved to battle against mordor .
they fought on the hang for the freedom of freedom .
victory was close .
but the power of ringes was not to break .
it happened when all the hope of schwand , that isildur , the king son , ergriff his father sword .
sauron , the enemy of the free peoples , was defeated .
the ring went to isildur , which had the opportunity to vernichten evil forever .
but the hearts of people are easily verführen .
and the ring of power has its own will .
he verriet and brought him death .
and what couldn &apos;t have been accepted was lost .
history became legend . legend became myth .
and for 2,500 years , the ring was remembered .
until one day , he was looking for new träger .
my treasure .
the ring fell into the substance of the creature in the hands of the nebelgebirge .
and there he verfiel the ring .
he &apos;s got to me .
my own .
my favorites .
my own .
my treasure .
the ring gave gollum an unnatural life .
for 500 years he vergiftete his mind .
and in the darkness of gollums cave , he was waiting .
darkness dropped over the forest &apos;s forest .
rumors became more than a shadow in the east . a namenloses ginge would be .
and the ring felt that his time had come .
he verließgollum .
but what happened was something that the ring didn &apos;t mind .
it was found by the unwahrscheinlichsten creature .
what is that ?
a hobbit .
bilbo beutlin from the auenland .
a ring .
disappeared !
my sweetie is gone !
because , soon , the hobbits is going to determine the fate of everyone .
the auenland 60 years later .
the street goes on and continues , away from the door , where she began to go far beyond land to place , i follow her , so good .
you come late .
a magician never gets too late , frodo beutlin .
or too early .
it seems like it &apos;s kind of intended .
what joy to see you , gandalf !
how could i forget uncle bilbos &apos;s birthday .
what does the world do ?
tell me everything .
everything ?
you &apos;re too curious about a hobbit .
extremely unusual .
what should i tell you ?
life in the wider world is just the same as the last age .
a constant come and go .
hardly anyone is aware of the existence of hobbits .
which i &apos;m very grateful for .
the langerwartete is solid .
how does the old tunichtgut show ?
as i heard , it should be a particularly aggressive celebration .
you know bilbo .
here &apos;s all from the fact .
right after that taste .
half auenland is invited .
you love .
he &apos;s leading what &apos;s in the schilde .
all right . so good .
just behalt it for you .
before you auftauchtest , we were beutlins angesehene people .
we were never verstrickt in adventure .
if you think about the dragon with the dragon , i was barely involved .
i just threw your uncle out to the door .
whatever you &apos;ve done , you &apos;re officially giltst as störenfried .
oh , really ?
a drip stamp , gandalf !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
i mean , my dear kid .
i also .
no , thank you .
no other visitors , gratulanten or distant relatives !
and what about very old friends ?
bilbo beutlin .
my lieber !
nice to see you . 111 years old .
is that believing ?
you &apos;re not a little bit gealtert .
come in !
welcome , welcome .
tea ? maybe something worse .
i &apos;ve got some bottles of old wingert . 1296 .
very good vintage .
almost as old as me .
it &apos;s got my father gekeltert .
what do you mean ? do we do one ?
just tea , thank you .
i expected you last week .
but you come and walk , as you can see .
always . i &apos;m a little unvorbereitet .
i just have cold chicken and essiggurken .
there &apos;s cheese .
no , it &apos;s not good anymore .
we have himbeermarmelade , an apple pie .
but not much for the night table .
oh no , we &apos;re rescued !
it &apos;s another biskuitkuchen there .
i could braten eggs .
just tea , thank you .
oh , of course .
bad if i eat ?
all right .
i &apos;m not at home !
i have to go away from this verflixten , never let you alone .
i want to see mountains again .
mountains , gandalf !
quiet place where i can finish my book .
oh , the tea .
then you want to do your plan ?
yeah .
everything is ready .
all the vorkehrungen are hit .
frodo hat verdacht .
of course he did .
he &apos;s a beutlin , no einfältiger straffgürtel from steinbüttel .
you say it , right ?
he loves you very much .
i know .
he would come up with , i would ask him .
i think deep inside of the body is still frodo .
in the woods , the fields .
the small rivers .
i &apos;m old , gandalf .
you don &apos;t see it , but i feel deep in my heart .
i feel skinny .
sort of ausgemergelt , like butter verstrichen too much bread .
i need a holiday .
very long holidays .
and i &apos;m probably not going to return .
i didn &apos;t think so .
old tobi .
the best kraut in südviertel .
gandalf , my old friend , on those night , we &apos;ll still remember that .
nice to see you .
there we go , sam .
challenge to the dance .
i prefer nochn beer .
oh no .
go ahead .
there i was , the grace of the three furchterregenden trolle .
they agreed about how to cook , whether or not they want to cook , or should they sit on us and zerquetschen .
they argued so long about this , and it &apos;s because of the first sunlight to go through the baumwipfel and turn them all into stone .
fast .
no , the big one .
like this -- it &apos;s got to stick in the ground .
it &apos;s in the ground . it &apos;s out there .
that was your idea .
watch , the dragon !
drache ? unsinn . there &apos;s no dragon for 1,000 years .
that was good .
let &apos;s get one !
meriadoc brandybock and peregrin tuk .
let me do it .
a speech , bilbo !
a speech !
my love lieben and boffins , tuks and brandybocks , grubers , pausbackens .
straffgürtels and stolzfußens .
today my 111 . birthday !
but unfortunately , einundelfzig years are far too short to live under this vortrefflichen hobbits .
i don &apos;t know half of you half as well as i want , and i like less than half of you like half the way you do it .
i did something .
it &apos;s a lot too long .
i &apos;m bedaure to have to kundtun that this is the end !
i &apos;m going now .
i &apos;m going to tell you very much .
probably lives .
you &apos;re probably extremely smart .
come on , gandalf .
have you seen your faces ?
there are many zauberringe in the world , and there &apos;s no need to use leichtfertig .
it was just a little fun .
you &apos;re probably right again , like always .
you &apos;re going to have an eye on frodo , right ?
two eyes .
that &apos;s how often i can entbehren them .
i leave him all .
what about your ring ?
does he stay here ?
yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s in an envelope on the kaminsims .
no .
isn &apos;t that strange ?
why not ?
why not keep it ?
you should leave the ring , bilbo .
is it so hard ?
well , no .
and yes .
now , because it &apos;s so far , i don &apos;t like it anymore .
i found him !
no reason to be indignant .
that &apos;s your fault !
it &apos;s my .
my own .
my treasure .
honey ?
so it &apos;s been called before , but not by you .
what do you think i do with my stuff ?
you had the ring for long enough .
you want to do it .
don &apos;t consider me for a wizard fauler hustles .
i don &apos;t want to paste you .
i want to help you .
all the years we were friends .
vertrau me , like earlier .
give it up .
you &apos;re right , gandalf .
the ring needs to go to frodo .
it &apos;s already late .
the path is long .
yes , it &apos;s time .
you still have the ring in your pocket .
here &apos;s the end of the book .
and he lived happy after the end of his day .
you &apos;re going to be sure my dear friend .
leb , wohl .
leb , thank you bilbo .
to our next meeting .
it &apos;s my .
my own .
my treasure .
mystery in darkness .
my treasure .
darling .
it &apos;s continued , right ?
he talked for so long . i thought it was a joke .
bilbos ring .
he went out to the elben and leave you .
with all his assets .
the ring belongs to you .
verstecke it good .
where do you want to go ?
i care about things .
what about things ?
ask . that &apos;s an answer .
you &apos;ve just come .
i don &apos;t understand that .
i don &apos;t .
hold it secret .
forbid good .
auenland !
beutlin !
the year &apos;s 3434 age .
these are the records of isildurs , the high king of gondor , about the fund of the power of power .
he came to me .
it &apos;s a ring .
he &apos;s seiein erbstück of my kingdom .
my descendants should be tied to his destiny , because i don &apos;t want to wagen the ring to the ring .
he &apos;s my treasure , even though i erkaufe it with great pain .
the lines on the ring start collapsing .
the typeface , first as a red flame , has disappeared .
a secret that can only charge fire .
auenland .
beutlin .
there &apos;s no beutlins here .
they &apos;re all in hobbingen .
over there .
does none of it know ?
is he gut good ?
what do you do ?
hold your hand up .
it &apos;s very cool .
what do you see ?
you see what ?
nothing .
there &apos;s nothing .
wait .
there are lines .
some kind of elbisch .
i can &apos;t read it .
very few can do that .
it &apos;s the language of mordor that i don &apos;t want to talk about here .
in our language it means .
a ring to knechten them , to find them all in the dark , and bind forever .
this is the ring , geschmiedet from the dark herrscher sauron in the fire of the schicksalsberges .
isildur cut him from saurons hand and took him .
bilbo found him .
in gollums cave .
60 years , the ring was in bilbos gewahrsam , verlängerte his life , didn &apos;t let him age .
but that &apos;s over .
evil comes into mordor .
the ring came up .
he belongs to his name .
but he was defeated .
sauron was defeated .
no , frodo .
the mind lived on .
his life &apos;s life is tied to the ring , and the ring stays .
sauron back .
his orks have become more .
his festung barad-dúr is back in mordor .
sauron just takes this ring to chase all the countries in darkness .
he &apos;s looking for him .
get it .
all his thoughts are in him .
and the ring wished nothing to do when to return to the hand of his meisters .
they &apos;re one , the ring and the dark ruler .
he can never find him .
all right .
we do it away .
we hide him and never mention him .
nobody knows where he is , right ?
or , gandalf ?
somebody knew that bilbo had the ring .
i was looking for the creature everywhere .
but the enemy was first discovered .
i weißnicht how long she folterten him .
but under thermonuclear scream and gestammel , they realized two words .
auenland .
beutlin .
that &apos;s going to be herführen .
who is there ?
take him , gandalf !
take it !
no . you have to take it .
don &apos;t vertrau him .
i &apos;ll give him .
don &apos;t try me , frodo !
i don &apos;t like to take him .
not even to verwahren him .
you understand , frodo . i would want to do good with this ring .
but through me , he would have a too big and appalling power .
but here it can &apos;t stay ! no .
it can &apos;t .
what do i have to do ?
you &apos;ve got to continue .
that &apos;s fast .
where ?
leave the auenland .
go to bree .
and what about you ?
i &apos;m waiting for you in the gasthauszum pony pony .
is that ring safe ?
i don &apos;t know , frodo .
i can &apos;t say it .
i have to meet the top of my ordens .
he &apos;s wise and powerful . vertrau me , frodo .
he knows advice .
you &apos;re going to have to ablegen the name .
it &apos;s too dangerous outside of the auenlandes .
journey only on the days .
and beyond the street .
i just go across .
my rather frodo .
hobbits are really amazing creatures .
in a month , you can learn everything about them .
and 100 years later , you can even be surprised .
duck .
in my barte , samweis gamdschie !
have you gehorcht ?
i never did .
i just cut the grass .
something late to cut grass !
i heard voices .
what have you heard ?
tell me ! nothing important .
i heard about a ring , a dark ruler .
please , sorry , nothing .
doesn &apos;t turn me into a ungeheuer .
no ?
maybe not .
i &apos;ve made something better .
come on , samweis .
not trödeln .
be careful , both of them .
the enemy has many späher .
birds , animals .
is he safe ?
never use it , because his power pulls out the servant of the dark herrschers .
always think of the ring to go back to his lord .
he wants to find .
it &apos;s so far .
what &apos;s so far ?
another step , and i &apos;m so far away from home as never before .
come on , sam .
bilbo has always said :
it &apos;s a dangerous thing to get out of your door .
you betrittst the road , and if you &apos;re not looking at your feet , you can &apos;t know where you wear you .
smoke goes up on the schicksalsberg .
it &apos;s very time .
and gandalf of the gray riding ride after isengart and ersucht me for advice .
because that &apos;s why you came , right ?
my old friend .
saruman .
are you sure ?
without any doubt .
so the ring of power was found .
all the years he was in the auenland .
right before my nose .
and yet , you didn &apos;t see it .
your preference for the kraut of the halblinge has come along the senses .
but it &apos;s still time to defeat sauron if we act quickly .
time ?
how much time do you think we have ?
sauron has wiedererlangt a lot of its former strength .
yet , he can &apos;t adopt a shape , but his mind has nothing to do .
hidden in his womb , the lord of mordor sees everything .
look at durchbohrt clouds , shadow , soil and meat .
you know what i &apos;m talking about , gandalf ?
a big eye , lidlos , umrandet of flames .
yeah . sauron .
he gathered all evil around .
soon , his army will be strong enough to attack mittelerde .
you know ?
where ?
i saw it .
a palantír is a dangerous tool , saruman .
why should we scheuen it ?
it &apos;s still ungeklärt where the anderensehenden steinesind .
we don &apos;t know who else is watching .
the time you think about it faster than you think .
saurons force is on the road .
the nine have left minas morgul .
they were crossing the river isen at the mittsommerabend in the form of black reitern .
they &apos;re in the auenland ?
you &apos;ll find the ring .
and they kill those who carry it .
frodo !
did you really think a hobbit came up against the will ?
there is nobody who &apos;s going to drive that .
the power of mordor can &apos;t be victory .
we need to engage with him , gandalf .
we need to be creative .
it would be smart , my friend .
tell me , my friend , since when does saruman the sense of reason ?
i gave you the opportunity to help me out of free , but you choose for the pain .
i thought i &apos;d lost you .
what are you talking about ?
gandalf said that .
what did he say ?
don &apos;t verlier him , samweis gamdschie . i won &apos;t .
we &apos;re still in auenland .
what can happen to us ?
merry , this is frodo beutlin .
down from him !
what do you do here ?
you stole a farmer maggots !
out of my field !
why does he act like this ?
it &apos;s just a few rüben .
and kohlköpfe .
and the three bag of potatoes last week .
and the mushrooms in the week before .
yeah , pippin .
let me tell you . he &apos;s responding completely .
run !
that was scarce .
i think i &apos;ve broken something .
typical brandybock and tuk !
what ?
that was just a shortcut .
germany .
where ?
fungi !
let &apos;s go down the street .
go down the street !
fast !
silent !
what was that ?
you see what ?
nothing .
what &apos;s going on ?
the black rider was looking for anything .
anyone .
duckt you !
i have to leave the auenland .
sam and i have to go to bree .
understand .
bockenburger ferry .
follow me .
follow me !
go off the tau , sam !
run , frodo !
fast !
where do you get over ?
over the brandywein-brücke . 20 miles .
come on .
what do you want ?
we want instänzelnde pony .
hobbits .
four hobbits .
what &apos;s going to lead you to bree ?
we want to stay in the gasthaus sleep .
the reason is our thing .
all right , young lord .
it wasn &apos;t bös .
after breaking the night i have to ask .
are strange people on the road .
you can &apos;t be careful enough .
sorry .
good evening , my little gentlemen .
if you look for housing , you &apos;re still nice , gemütliche room in hobbit-größe .
mr. ?
unterberg .
my name is unterberg .
unterberg .
we want to gandalf the gray .
i know . this is an old age of age .
a long , joie beard , spitzer hat .
it &apos;s been no longer here for six months .
now what do we do ?
he &apos;s coming .
what is that ?
that , my friend , is a krug beer .
you drink it from krügen ?
i &apos;m going to get one .
you &apos;ve had a whole half .
the guy staring at you since we &apos;re here .
sorry .
the guy in the corner .
who is that ?
one of the waldläufern .
dangerous people , wanderndes people .
i don &apos;t know his proper name , but it &apos;s called streicher .
streicher .
beutlin .
beutlin .
beutlin .
clearly i know a beutlin .
there he is .
my favorite two degree , my mütterlicherseits , and my favorite three degree .
pass up .
you can &apos;t hide you .
i see you .
there is no life in nothing .
only death .
her erregt aufmerksamkeit , mr. unterberg .
what do you want ?
you don &apos;t have a little bit of a difference with you .
i don &apos;t wear anything . of course .
i can avoid that you can see me , but to disappear , is a rare gift .
who are you ?
do you fürchtest ?
yeah .
by far , not enough .
i know who &apos;s tracking you .
leave him alone , long misery !
you have a wackeres heart , smaller .
but it doesn &apos;t save you .
no longer on the magician , frodo .
they come .
who are you ?
once they were people .
great kings of people .
then sauron of the verräter gave you the nine rings of power .
blind before habgier they took them to ask them .
and they fell into darkness .
now they &apos;re slaves of their willing .
they are the nazgûl .
ringgeister .
neither alive nor alive .
at all times , they feel the presence of ringes , driven by the power of one .
they &apos;re going to hunt forever .
where does it take us ?
in the wild .
how do we know that streicher is a friend of mine ?
we need to trust him .
but where does it take us ?
after bruchtal , mr. gamdschie .
elronds home .
do you hear that ?
after bruchtal .
we &apos;ll see the elben .
we stop at the night .
what about breakfast ? what did you do .
the first one , yes .
what about the second breakfast ?
i don &apos;t think he knows this , pip .
and the 11-uhr-imbiss ?
lunch ?
4-uhr-tee ?
dinner ?
nachtmahl ?
he knows that , right ?
don &apos;t expect with that .
the power is ready for you , sauron , herrscher of the earth .
give me an army worthy of mordors .
new instructions from mordor , my gebieter ?
what drives the eye ?
there &apos;s work .
the trees are strong , my gebieter .
their roots go deep .
reißt everybody out .
this was the wachturm of amon sûl .
so here we are tonight .
they are for you .
they always tragt with you .
i &apos;ll see myself .
there it is .
what do you do ?
tomatoes , sausage , knuspriger bacon .
it &apos;s also what it is .
do that , your tölpel !
ashes on my tomatoes !
up .
back , your devils !
help him , streicher .
a morgulklinge has injured him .
i don &apos;t have my heilkunst .
it needs elbische medicine .
fast !
it &apos;s six tagesmärsche to bruchtal ! it never makes it .
hang on , frodo .
it gets very cold .
will he die ?
he enters over into the schattenwelt .
soon , he &apos;s a mind like her .
they &apos;re very close .
do you know the athelas-pflanze ?
königskraut .
yeah , that &apos;s a unkraut .
it keeps the vergiftung . beeil .
a waldläufer that &apos;s not on the hat ?
i &apos;m a arwen .
i come to help you .
hear my voice .
come back to light !
who is she ?
it &apos;s a elbenfrau .
he schwindet .
it doesn &apos;t make it long .
let &apos;s bring him to my father .
i &apos;ve been looking for two days .
five ringgeister are behind you .
where the other four are , i don &apos;t know .
stay in the hobbits .
i &apos;ll send you horses .
i reite faster .
the road is too dangerous .
what are they talking about ?
when i überquere the river , the power of my people will protect him .
i &apos;m not afraid .
reite fast . don &apos;t look back .
what are you doing ?
the ringgeister are still there !
give us the halbling , elbenweib !
you want it , come on and demand him .
frodo , no .
frodo , don &apos;t give up .
not now .
the grace that i found may go to him .
close to it .
save it .
where am i ?
you &apos;re in elronds houses .
it &apos;s 10 o &apos;clock morning october of october 24 , if you want to know .
yeah , i &apos;m here .
and you &apos;re lucky that you &apos;re here .
a few hours , and we couldn &apos;t have help you .
but you have some force in you , rather than hobbit .
what &apos;s happening , gandalf ?
why didn &apos;t you come ?
sorry , frodo .
i got aufgehalten .
the friendship sarumans is not leichtfertig .
a bad twist is the other value .
it &apos;s over .
choose the power of ringes , or choose your own doom .
lord of the ringes .
he &apos;s just going to win that the ring beugt his will .
and he doesn &apos;t share his power .
so you wählst death .
what do you have ?
nothing , frodo .
how beautiful , you &apos;re awake .
sam wich is barely by your side .
we were frightened of you , right ?
thanks to the arts of elrond , you slow down .
welcome to bruchtal , frodo beutlin .
hello , frodo , my boy .
back and back .
the story of a hobbits . von beutlin .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i wanted to go back to see the miracle düsterwalds , visit seestadt , see the lone mountain again .
but as it seems , i &apos;m going to stop now .
i miss the auenland .
in my childhood , i was like , i continue .
you know , continue to experience adventure together .
my own adventure then looked very different .
i &apos;m not like you , bilbo .
my dear kid .
what did i forget ?
you &apos;ve been packed ?
i just want to be prepared .
you know , you wanted to see the elben .
right .
more than anything .
yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s just .
we did what gandalf wanted , not ?
we brought the ring to bruchtal .
and i thought , well , i &apos;m going to take you better , let &apos;s stop .
home .
you &apos;re right , sam .
we &apos;ve done what we should do .
the ring will be safe in bruchtal .
i &apos;m ready to go home .
it comes again to forces .
the wound will never quite verheilen .
he &apos;s wearing it as long as he lives .
and yet , he has come far along with the ring , and he was extremely resilient to the evil .
this burden would never have allowed him to be allowed .
you can &apos;t demand from him .
the enemy stops .
saurons force is in the east .
his eye looks at bruchtal .
and saruman may tell us .
the list of our followers is short .
sein is more than you know .
faule orks has saruman orks with bilwißmenschen gekreuzt .
he grows an army in the verliesen isengarts .
it &apos;s an army that is also growing up and forth in sunlight .
saruman wants to get the ring .
even the power of elben is not grown by evil .
we &apos;re missing the force to fight mordor and isengart !
the ring can &apos;t stay here .
this threat is entirely mittelerde .
you have to decide how to address your face .
the time of elben is over .
my people leave this gestade .
who will you turn to ?
the zwerge ?
they &apos;re looking for wealth .
they don &apos;t care about the other .
in humans , we need to have our hope .
people .
people are weak .
people &apos;s people failed .
the blood of númenor is kraftlos , all his pride and his dignity .
because of the überdauert , the ring is the time .
i was there , gandalf .
i was there 3,000 years ago , and when isildur took the ring .
i was there as the strength of the people .
isildur ! quick !
follow me .
i led isildur to the heart of the schicksalsberges where the ring had been forged .
it was only there . throw it into the fire !
vernichte him ! no .
it should have stopped , but evil was allowed to continue .
isildur kept the ring .
the line of kings is interrupted .
there is no strength in the world of people .
they &apos;re zerstreut , zerstritten , führerlos .
only one could unite them .
one who could get back to the throne .
he went off a long time ago .
he chose the exile .
the geborstene sword narsil .
the blade , which is cut the ring of saurons hand .
it &apos;s even sharp .
just a zerbrochenes erbstück .
why do you fürchtest the past ?
you &apos;re isildurs legacy , not isildur itself .
you &apos;re not bound to your destiny .
the same blood flows through my veins .
same weakness .
your time will come .
you &apos;re going to face the same evil evil .
and you will beat it .
the shadow has no power yet .
neither about you nor me .
do you remember our first encounter ?
i felt a dream .
for a long years , since then .
don &apos;t worry about that at the time .
do you know what i said at the time ?
you said you would take the bund with me , and you would entsagen the immortality of your people .
and i &apos;m stuck with that .
one single life with you than all the ages of the world alone .
that &apos;s how i choose a sterbliches life .
you can &apos;t give me .
you &apos;ve been hergerufen to defy the threat of mordors .
mittelerde stands on the edge of the mass mass .
nobody can avoid it .
verbündet you , or you &apos;re under .
every people is ausgeliefert that fate , on gedeih and verderb .
hole out of the ring , frodo .
so it &apos;s true .
he &apos;s a gift .
a gift to widersacher mordors .
why not use it ?
for a long time , my father , the truchseß of gondor , abgewehrt force .
with the blood of our people , we defend your countries .
give gondor the weapon of the enemy .
let &apos;s use it against him .
you can &apos;t use it .
nobody can .
it &apos;s a ring of gehorcht sauron alone .
he &apos;s just dominated him .
and what does a waldläufer of these things understand ?
it &apos;s more than that .
this is aragorn , arathorns son .
you &apos;re a verpflichtet .
so that &apos;s isildurs legacy ?
and thronerbe from gondor .
sit down , legolas .
gondor has no king .
gondor doesn &apos;t need king .
aragorn is right .
we can &apos;t use it .
there &apos;s only one way .
the ring needs to be annihilated .
what are we waiting for ?
the ring can &apos;t be destroyed , gimli , glóins son , none of the art that we master .
in the firing of the schicksalsberges , it can only be wiped out there .
you have to get it deep to mordor , and in the feurige kluft , which he comes from .
one of you must do that .
you don &apos;t just go to mordor .
his black gates are werden by schlimmerem bewacht than just orks .
the evil there never sleeps .
and the great eye is always wachsam .
it &apos;s a karges ödland , übersät with fire , ashes and dust .
the air you breathe is toxic steam .
not with 10,000 husband , you could do that .
it &apos;s insane .
don &apos;t you hear your mr. elrond ?
the ring needs to be annihilated .
and you think you &apos;re the one who does it !
and now if it &apos;s misslingt ? when sauron , what is it hearing ?
rather , i want to die when to see the ring in the hands of a elben .
nobody traut a elben !
don &apos;t you guess ?
as your herumzankt , it grows saurons !
nobody entrinnt her !
you &apos;re all vernichtet !
i &apos;ll take it .
i &apos;m going to bring the ring to mordor .
although i don &apos;t know the path .
i &apos;ll help you carry the burden as long as it might be imposed .
i can protect you through life or death , i &apos;ll do it .
you have my sword .
and you have my bow .
and my ax .
you bestimmst our fate , little .
if this is the will of the rates , it &apos;s gondor .
mr. frodo is walking without me .
it &apos;s not possible to separate you , even if it &apos;s invited to a secret counseling and you &apos;re not .
we &apos;re coming with !
or you need to put us in a bag of verschnürt heimschicken .
you need people with minds for this task .
search .
thing .
and then you &apos;re scheidest , pip .
nine gefährten .
that &apos;s it .
you form the community of ringes .
great .
where do we go ?
my old sword .
clean .
take it .
it &apos;s so easy .
yeah .
the elben have forged it .
the blade schimmert blue , when orks are near .
and in times like this , you have to be very careful .
here &apos;s what beautiful .
mithril .
it &apos;s just like a feather and hard wie .
legs time .
my old ring .
i &apos;d like to put it in the hand , last time .
i &apos;m sorry i have the aufgebürdet .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re wearing this burden now .
i &apos;m sorry .
we have to follow the rfad west of the nebelgebirges 40 days .
if we &apos;re lucky enough , the rforte will be open to us .
from there , we biegen towards mordor .
good !
very good .
move your feet .
not bad , pippin .
faster !
i would ask anybody to ask me what nobody does , i would suggest , we umweg a umweg .
we could go through the mines .
my vetter balin would receive us königlich .
no . i was only going through moria , i would have no other choice .
on him !
- !
shut it up , merry .
what is that ?
just a wolkenfetzen .
but it &apos;s moving fast .
and against the wind .
crebain from dunland !
hide you !
in deckung !
späher sarumans .
they observe the way to south .
we need to take the passport of the caradhras .
strange skill makes us so scared and doubts because of such a small dinges .
this is a little thing .
give frodo the ring .
you want .
i &apos;m the same .
well , gandalf , you &apos;re trying to get you to the caradhras .
and if the fehlschlägt , which way can you choose ?
if the mountain defeated you , you would be wagt away .
it &apos;s bad voices in the air .
this is sarunam !
it takes the mountain to collapse .
we have to reverse !
no !
we have to leave the mountain !
on the pforte of rohan , and about the west-fold to my city .
the pforte of rohan takes us too close to isengart .
we can &apos;t .
let &apos;s go through it .
let &apos;s go through the mines of moria .
you fürchtest in front of these mines .
the zwerge have become greedy and too geschürft .
you know what they aufweckten in the darkness of khazad-dûm .
shadow and light .
let &apos;s decide the ringträger .
we go through the mines .
that &apos;s it .
the walls of moria .
well , let &apos;s see .
ithildin .
it &apos;s just a starlight or a flashlight .
here &apos;s the doors of durin , the lord of moria .
go , friend , and come in .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;re a friend , say the losungswort , and the door will open .
mines are not a place for pony .
not even for the brave lutz .
lebwohl , lutz .
with you .
don &apos;t worry , sam . he knows the way home .
don &apos;t schrecke the water .
no , it &apos;s pointless .
it &apos;s a mystery .
talk , friend and juggling .
how heißtfreundauf elbisch ?
mellon .
soon , elbenherr , you learn the famous hospitality of the zwerge .
prasselnde kaminfeuer , malzbier , good abgehangenes meat !
this , my friend , is balin home .
and they call it einemine .
einemine !
this is not a mine .
it &apos;s a grave .
these were bilwißmenschen .
on the pforte of rohan .
we would never be here .
let &apos;s go from here .
out !
in the mines !
legolas !
run !
we only have one option .
we have to take it with the long darkness .
be on the hat !
there are older and gemeinere creatures as orks in the deep world .
quiet now .
we need four days to the other side .
hopefully our present is missing .
i don &apos;t remember that one .
did we run ?
i think so .
gandalf thinks .
what ?
i was hungry .
there &apos;s something down there .
this is gollum .
he follows us for three days .
he moved out of the verliesen of barad-dûr ?
or oil was released .
he hates and loves the ring , like he hates himself and loves .
his desire for him will never be erlöschen .
a jammer that bilbo didn &apos;t kill him at the time .
it was pity to zurückhielt the bilbos hand .
many who live , deserve death .
some people die , they deserve life .
can you give it to you , frodo ?
not so fast with a death sentence at hand .
because even the species don &apos;t recognize all the intentions .
my heart tells me that gollum has a role to play -- for good or evil -- before everything ends .
bilbos pity likes to determine the fate of many .
i wish i could never have the ring , and all that would never have happened .
that &apos;s what all of these things are doing .
but you don &apos;t choose to do that .
we just have to decide what we &apos;re going to do with the time that we &apos;re given .
it &apos;s different forces , not just the power of evil .
bilbo was ausersehen to find the ring , as well as you were ausersehen .
and this is a ermutigender thought .
there we go .
he remembers .
but here , the air stinkt not like that .
in the zweifelsfall , meriadoc , always your nose .
let me give you a little bit more light .
see ! the big empire and the city zwergenbinge .
a true augenöffner , no question .
here lies balin balin , fundins son , lord of moria .
so he &apos;s dead .
i had befürchtet .
we need to continue .
we &apos;re not allowed to stay .
they took the bridge and the second hall .
we have the gates versperrt , but we can &apos;t keep them long .
the earth bebt .
drums . drums in the depth .
we can &apos;t move out .
a shadow moves in the darkness .
we can &apos;t move out .
they come .
närrischer tuk !
throw out yourself , so you don &apos;t do any trouble .
orks .
back . leave behind gandalf !
they have a höhlentroll .
should you come .
there &apos;s a dwarf in moria that breathes .
slowly , i &apos;ll get the handle out .
oh , no .
he lives .
i don &apos;t have anything .
i &apos;m a unverletzt .
you had to be dead .
the shock had a wild eber aufgespießt .
there &apos;s more on this hobbit than the eye sees .
mithril .
you have full surprises , mr. beutlin .
to bridge khazad-dûm .
what is this new teufelei ?
a balrog .
a dämon of the old world .
this enemy is all thinking about you .
run !
fast !
keep running , aragorn .
the bridge is close .
do what i say !
schwerter are nothing more .
nobody throws a dwarf .
not on the beard !
caution !
wait !
hang on !
beug forward !
caution .
over the bridge !
flieht !
you can &apos;t go over !
i &apos;m a servant of the secret fire , gebieter over the flame of anor .
the dark fire will not make you good , flamme by udûn !
go back to the shadows .
you can &apos;t go over !
flieht , you fools .
no !
legolas , high with them .
let &apos;s give you some time .
when it gets dark , it &apos;s all over here .
we need to go into the forests of forests .
come on , boromir .
legolas , gimli , help you .
stand up , sam .
stay near , young hobbits !
you say a big zauberin lives in these forests .
a elbenhexe of entsetzlicher power .
everybody you see , erliegen your bann .
and never seen again .
you come to us as a vorbote of destiny .
you take that evil to us , ringträger .
after all , there &apos;s a dwarf that doesn &apos;t make it so easily .
i have the eyes of a habichts and the ears of a fuchses .
the dwarf breathes is so loud , we could have shot it in the dark .
haldir of lórien .
we come to erbitten help .
we need your protection .
these forests are dangerous .
we should reverse .
you &apos;ve entered the realm of the forest . you can &apos;t reverse .
come on .
she would expect you .
here &apos;s eight , eight are broken by bruchtal .
tell me where is gandalf ?
because it requires me to talk to him .
it goes down to the shadows .
your ride stands on a messers .
just take a weniges , and it &apos;s going to fail , which means the decline of everybody .
and yet hope is true as the community is true .
let &apos;s not make your heart hard .
you &apos;re supposed to sit , you &apos;re exhausted for so much grief and scourge .
heut night schlaft her in peace ...
welcome , frodo from the auenland who saw the eye .
a klagelied for gandalf .
what do you say about him ?
my heart doesn &apos;t make it translate .
to me , grief is still too close .
sleep a little bit .
these boundaries are gut .
i don &apos;t find any sleep .
i heard her voice in my head .
she was talking about my father and the case .
she said , even now there is hope .
but i don &apos;t see them .
it &apos;s long ago that we were hoping .
my father is a edler man , but a weak ruler , and our people are losing trust .
i want to turn it all for him . that would be me .
i would go back to light .
have you ever seen him , aragorn ?
the white tower ecthelions ?
glitzernd like a dorn of beads and silver .
his flag , bright in morgenwind .
have you ever heard the bright sound trompeten trompeten ?
i saw the white city a long time ago .
and one day , our way will lead us .
and this is a tower called erschallen .
the lord gondors are back .
are you looking in the mirror ?
what am i going to see ?
it doesn &apos;t always know the weiseste , because the mirror shows a lot of things .
things that were . things that are . and things .
i know what you &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;ll take the same thing .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen when you get away .
the community breaks down .
it already started .
he &apos;s going to try to take him .
you know who i &apos;m talking about .
in a row , he &apos;s going to vernichten them all .
if you require it , i want to give you a ring .
you give him freiwillig ?
i don &apos;t know that my heart has really taken this .
instead of a dark herrschers , you would have a queen , not dark , but beautiful and appalling like the morning !
tückisch like the lake !
more than the grundfesten of the earth !
everybody will love me and to despair .
i &apos;ll give the exam .
i &apos;m going to get weaker and go to the west .
and stay galadriel .
i can &apos;t do that alone .
you &apos;re a ringträger , frodo .
wearing a ring , means to be alone .
this task is defined for you .
and if you don &apos;t find any way , nobody finds it .
then i know what i need to do .
it &apos;s just -- i &apos;m afraid of it .
even the smallest can change the course of destiny .
do you know how the orks erblickten the world ?
they were elben , but they were tortured by the dark powers and mutilated .
an destroyed and horrible life form .
full of it .
my kämpfender uruk-hai ! who are you dienest ?
saruman .
click on !
until you found them !
you don &apos;t know fear nor pain .
you &apos;re going to cost menschenfleisch !
one of the halblinge carries something very valuable .
bring them alive and safe .
kills the other .
i &apos;ll give you the light , our beloved star .
may you be a light in dark places when all the other lights go out .
the argonath .
finally , i see the kings of the altvorderen .
my ancestors .
we cross the lake at night , we hide the boats and we travel .
we &apos;re approaching mordor from north .
so we only have to fight through the emyn muil , a maze from messerscharfen rock .
and then it gets better .
schwärende , stinkende sumpflandschaft , so far the eye .
that &apos;s our way .
schlaft a little bit and recovered , herr .
recovered !
let &apos;s stop .
no .
orks guard the ostufer .
let &apos;s wait until it &apos;s dark .
i &apos;m not worried about the ostufer .
a bedrohlicher shadow of mine .
something pulls up .
i feel it .
a dwarf doesn &apos;t have to recover .
just not notice , young hobbit .
where is frodo ?
no one should be alone .
you don &apos;t .
so much depends on you .
i know why you seek the loneliness .
you quälst .
i see it day for day .
don &apos;t you cut you unnecessary ?
there are other ways , frodo .
other pathways that we can choose .
i know what you want to say .
it would be like my heart didn &apos;t bother me .
warning ?
what ?
we all have fear , frodo .
but by fear to destroy hope , it &apos;s insane .
there &apos;s no other way .
i just want the strength to defend my people !
do you send me the ring ...
no !
i &apos;m not a dieb .
you &apos;re not yourself .
what &apos;s the story you &apos;ve got ?
you &apos;ll find yourself .
they take the ring .
and you &apos;re going to highlight death !
verfluchter narr !
an f chance gave him .
he could have been mine .
he should be my !
give him me !
give me .
no .
i know what you have in mind .
you want to bring your ring to the ring !
you want to tell us !
you &apos;re going to go to the arms and you &apos;re going to take it all over us .
i verfluche you !
you and all halblinge !
what did i do ?
please , frodo .
frodo ! i &apos;m sorry !
he has boromirs bemächtigt .
where is the ring ?
stay away !
i schwor to protect you .
even before you ?
would you destroy it ?
i &apos;d gone to the end with you .
up into the fire .
i know .
join the other .
especially sam .
he won &apos;t understand it .
go , frodo .
run !
find the halblinge !
aragorn , run .
hide here !
come on .
what did he do ?
he leaves us .
no !
run , frodo .
hey , you go there !
here we are !
here !
it works !
i see that !
horn gondors .
run !
they have the little !
hang on .
where is frodo ?
i let him draw .
you &apos;ve done what i couldn &apos;t do .
i wanted to take him off the ring .
the ring is unerreichbar now .
verzeih me .
i couldn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve all told you .
no , boromir .
you fought tapfer .
you &apos;ve got your honor .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s over .
human beings are untergehen .
everything versinkt in darkness . my city falls into rubble .
i don &apos;t know what force i have , but i swear to you , neither the white city , still our people are failing .
our people .
i would follow you , my brother .
my hauptmann .
my king .
peace is with you , son gondors .
i wish i could never have the ring .
and all of that would have happened .
that &apos;s what all of these things are going to experience . but they don &apos;t choose to do that .
you just have to decide what you &apos;re going to do with the time that you &apos;re given .
frodo , not !
no , sam .
go back , sam !
i &apos;m just going to mordor .
of course .
and i come with you !
you can &apos;t swim !
i promised habs , mr. frodo .
promised .
don &apos;t verlier him , samweis gamdschie .
and i &apos;m not going to .
i &apos;m not going to .
come .
fast !
frodo and sam have reached the eastern bank .
you don &apos;t want to follow them .
frodos fate is no longer in our hand .
then everything was free .
the community failed .
it &apos;s not when we connect true .
we leave merry and pippin not torture and death .
not as long as we have power .
let &apos;s do everything here .
just light gepäck .
let &apos;s chase orks .
the others may find a safer way .
streicher will take care of them .
we &apos;ll probably never see them again .
maybe , mr. frodo .
maybe .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re at me .
you can &apos;t go over !
gandalf !
i &apos;m a servant of the secret fire , gebieter over the flame of anor .
back into the shadows !
the dark fire will not make you good , flamme by udûn !
you can &apos;t go over !
no !
no !
gandalf !
flieht , you fools !
no !
gandalf !
gandalf !
what do you have , mr. frodo ?
nothing .
i forgot .
can you see the floor ?
no , not hinuntersehen , sam !
just weiterklettern !
start ' .
stop , mr. frodo !
mr. frodo !
i think i found the ground .
sumpf and ropes and knows the kuckuck , which is still .
that &apos;s not natural .
all of that .
what &apos;s in there ?
there &apos;s nothing . ' n little things to taste .
for the case , we &apos;re eating a brathähnchen or something .
a brathähnchen ?
you can never know .
sam , my good sam !
that &apos;s very special .
the best salt in auenland .
it &apos;s really something special .
a piece of home .
we can &apos;t hierlassen that ; it could give us a hinunterfolgen .
who should runterfolgen us here , mr. frodo ?
actually , a jammer woman gave it to me .
real elbenseil .
well , you can &apos;t do anything .
the knot comes from me .
so fast , it certainly isn &apos;t .
real , real elbenseil .
mordor !
the only place in mittelerde that we don &apos;t want to see from close .
and that &apos;s the place we &apos;re looking for .
we can &apos;t get to that .
don &apos;t do anything , mr. frodo . we &apos;ve lost .
i don &apos;t think gandalf had planned this way for us .
there &apos;s a lot of things he didn &apos;t plan , sam . but it &apos;s happening .
mr. frodo ?
it &apos;s the ring , right ?
it gets harder .
well , what else do we have in a quality of life ?
let &apos;s see .
oh yeah , tasty !
lembas-brot .
and the most amazing ...
more lembas-brot .
fremdländische kitchen , i don &apos;t like it , but this is not übel .
there &apos;s nothing to get to trüben you , right , sam ?
just the regenwolken .
it &apos;s kind of familiar with me .
because we &apos;ve been here before .
we go around .
what a grauenhafter smell !
this is where there must be a ekelhaftes moor .
do you do that ?
yeah , i smell it .
we &apos;re not alone .
the diebe .
they diebe !
the dirty little diebe !
where is he ?
they stole him , my sweetie .
cursed are you ! we hate them !
he &apos;s our , yeah , and we want him !
that &apos;s down . you &apos;ve seen it before .
am i right , gollum ?
let &apos;s go back immediately or i cut the throat .
it burns !
it burns us !
it friert us !
garstige elben have zusammengedreht .
take it off of us !
right now !
it &apos;s hopeless !
every ork in ganz is going to hear this geschrei !
we fesseln him and then let him here .
no , no , that will kill us , killing us !
what else did you not deserve !
maybe he really earned death .
but now i see it , i &apos;m sorry with him .
we &apos;ll be nice to you if you &apos;re nice to us .
take it off of us !
we &apos;re going to promise what they want us to do .
we promise ' .
you can &apos;t make a promise that i can leave on .
we kick it ! we &apos;re going to serve him , the lord of the schatzes !
we &apos;re going to schwören ... on the treasure .
gollum .
gollum .
the ring is verräterisch .
so hang on your word !
yeah . in the treasure .
on the treasure .
i don &apos;t think so .
come down ! come down !
sam !
he just wants to reinlegen us !
if we run it , he erdrosselt us in sleep !
you know the way to mordor ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve been there ?
yeah .
then you will lead to the black gate .
the gate ! to tor !
the gate says the lord !
yes !
we don &apos;t want back .
not there .
not to him .
they can &apos;t force us .
gollum !
gollum !
but we have geschworen to serve the lord of the schatzes .
no !
ashes and thirst and thirst are there , there &apos;s ' , caves , caves , caves .
and orkse ! thousands of orksen !
and always the big eye , wachend and lifestyle .
come back immediately !
come back !
there !
what did i say to you ?
he &apos;s abgehauen , this gauner !
so much to his promises !
there , hobbits ! follow me !
follow me !
merry !
merry !
you get late .
our lord is being impatient .
he wants the auenland-ratten now .
i don &apos;t befolge orders of orkmaden !
saruman will get its prey .
we &apos;re going to deliver them .
merry !
merry !
wake up !
my friend is sick .
it needs water .
please !
he &apos;s sick ?
then he gets a little medicine , guys .
stop !
don &apos;t verträgt his train !
let &apos;s stop it !
how ?
do you want what ?
and then you shut your mouth .
merry .
hello , pip .
do you mind ?
i don &apos;t have anything .
just did .
did you ?
you see ?
you &apos;re also on top of it .
don &apos;t worry about me , pippin .
what &apos;s going on ?
what do you do ?
menschenfleisch .
they &apos;re on the fährte .
aragorn .
further !
they march faster .
you have to have gewittert .
quick !
come on , gimli !
three days and nights we &apos;re tracking them .
without food .
rast .
and no sign of those we &apos;re looking for , except nacktem stone .
don &apos;t futile lóriens leaves !
you might be alive .
and it &apos;s just a tagesmarsch advance .
come on !
come on , gimli !
we get them .
i &apos;m not a gebrauchen country .
we &apos;re more zwerge spurter .
mordsgefährlich about short distances .
rohan .
home of pferdeherren .
strange is the work here .
something bad gives that creature to these creatures and it makes his will against us .
legolas !
what &apos;s your elbenauge ?
their tracks leads to nord-westen .
the uruks takes the hobbits to isengart !
saruman .
the world is changing .
now , who says to the army of isengart and mordor ?
who claims the power and sarumans and against the bündnis of the two towers ?
together , sauron , my gebieter , we &apos;re going to be herrschen about mittelerde .
the old world will burn into the firing of the schmelzöfen .
the forests are falling .
a new order will happen .
we &apos;re going to drive the kriegsmaschinerie with sword and spear and the iron faust of the orks .
i want to be armed and armed in two weeks .
but , my lord , it &apos;s too many .
so far , not all of us can be armed . we don &apos;t have the resources .
build a dam , staut the river , heizt the öfen day and night .
we &apos;re missing fuel , so many öfen fuel .
the forest of fangorn is in front of our door .
drop it down .
we fight for you .
swear !
in death for saruman !
the pferdemenschen took your country !
your people were hunted into the mountains and now lives on kargem rock .
murderer !
get back what you stole ! burns everything down !
we just have to eliminate those who are against us .
in rohan , it will start .
the farmers there have widersetzt to you too long .
now this has a end .
éothain !
éothain !
you take your sister .
you &apos;re going to go faster if you &apos;re just too zweit .
daddy failed to ride on gárulf .
he &apos;s too big for him !
don &apos;t listen to me .
you &apos;ve got to beat edoras and alarm .
did you understand what i say ?
yes , mama .
i don &apos;t want to continue .
i don &apos;t want to go from here , mama !
freda , i &apos;m going to get progeny soon .
fast !
reite , child !
rohan , my lord , is in front of the case .
théodred .
he &apos;s looking for the king son !
mordor is going to pay for it .
these orks are not from mordor .
my lord éomer , over here !
he lives .
théodred .
your son is hard to verwundet , sir .
he was invaded by orks .
if we don &apos;t defend our country , it will be saruman .
this is a lie .
saruman of the white was always our friend and verbündeter , allseits and since .
gríma .
gríma .
gríma .
orks stripes are now free through our country , ungestört , with willkürlich mordend .
orks with the sign of the white hand .
why are you beschwert to be more comfortable with besorgtes ?
don &apos;t you see ?
your uncle is very much dependent on you unzufriedenheit and kriegstreiberei .
kriegstreiberei ?
how long is it that saruman bought you ?
what was the versprochene price , gríma ?
you have a part of your prey , and you &apos;re all beseitigt ?
too long , you &apos;ve seen my sister .
too long you &apos;ve got your steps .
you see a lot , éomer , éomunds son .
too much .
you &apos;re immediately verbannt out of the kingdom , and all of your herrschaftsgebieten , and come back to your death .
you have no befugnis here .
your instructions don &apos;t mean anything .
now , your irrt , this is not a command of me .
he comes from king .
he signed him this morning .
weiteratmen .
that &apos;s the trick . breathe !
breathe !
they run as if the sticks of their gentlemen were behind them .
ork 1 : we &apos;re just going to go ahead and take a verschnaufpause .
schürt a fire , go !
merry !
merry !
i think it was a mistake of leaving the auenland , pippin .
what are these kinds of sound ?
these are the trees .
do you remember the old-growth forest on the border to bockland ?
they used to say there was something in the water that makes the trees hochwachsen and even make it alive .
alive ?
trees , flüstern , talk to each other and even move .
i &apos;m a starving .
just this madige bread and this for three stinkenden days .
yes !
why don &apos;t we get meat here ?
how about those of you ?
they &apos;re fresh .
they &apos;re not there for food .
what about their legs ?
they don &apos;t need them .
oh , look the delicious !
back , you follow it .
the prisoners go to saruman .
it &apos;s alive and alive .
alive ?
why alive ?
can you play with them ?
they have something in it .
a elbische weapon .
the gentleman needs it for the war .
you think we have the ring .
scht !
if you find out that we don &apos;t have it , we &apos;re dead .
hackt them . just a happen !
immediately , meat is on the speiseplan .
pippin !
go on , come on !
just to !
he calls for help !
quiekt !
now nobody will save you .
pippin !
a red sun goes up .
tonight , blood has been vergossen .
your rider of rohan , what &apos;s new in the mark ?
what &apos;s a elb , a human and a dwarf here in the riddermark ?
quick !
call me your name , pferdeherr , then i &apos;ll call you my name .
i would abschlagen you the head , zwerg if it just ragte a little bit over the ground .
you were going to die before you go to streich .
i &apos;m a aragorn , arathorns son .
this is gimli , glóins son , and legolas from the waldlandreich .
we are friends rohans and théodens , our own king .
théoden won &apos;t be unterscheiden from the enemy .
he doesn &apos;t recognize his sippe .
saruman vergiftet the spirit of the king and challenges the regime of this country .
my flock consists of those who are true to rohan .
and we were banned for that .
the white magician is listenreich .
he appears here and there , called the old man in kapuze and coat .
and all over the way , its spitzel are out of our nets .
we &apos;re not spitzel .
we &apos;re tracking a group of uruk-hai westwärts over the plane .
they &apos;ve captured two of our friends .
the uruks are annihilated .
we &apos;re all erschlugen at night .
but there were two hobbits !
have you seen two hobbits ?
they &apos;d have been small , just kids in your eyes .
we didn &apos;t let anyone alive .
we put it on a pile , and we burned them .
you &apos;re dead ?
i &apos;m sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
like , these horses like a better skill than their last gentleman .
probably lives .
looking for your friends .
but don &apos;t make you hope .
it &apos;s lost in these land .
we ride !
this is one of their gürteln .
we let them down .
a hobbit was here .
and here &apos;s the other .
they &apos;re gekrochen .
their hands were gefesselt .
the fesseln has been cut .
then they &apos;re langgelaufen here .
they were tracked .
the belt !
run ' .
the traces continues from battle . for fangorn-wald .
fangorn ?
what &apos;s the amazing thing to do ?
have we abgehängt him ?
i believe yes , right ?
i get your mistigen little eingeweide out !
come here !
trees .
on a tree , pippin !
it &apos;s gone .
merry !
now i bohr you in the wanst !
run , merry !
little orks , burárum !
he &apos;s talking merry .
the tree speaks !
tree ?
i &apos;m not a tree .
i &apos;m a ent .
a baumhirte .
a shepherd &apos;s shepherd .
don &apos;t talk to him , merry !
don &apos;t get it out .
baumbart call me some .
and ... whose side are you ?
side ?
i &apos;m on the side of nowhere . because nobody is on my side , little ork .
no one &apos;s in the forest yet .
we &apos;re not orks .
we are hobbits !
hobbits ?
i &apos;ve never heard anything about a hobbit .
sounds like ork-teufelei .
they come with fire .
they come with äxten .
nagend , beißend , brechend , hackend , brennend !
zerstörer , eindringlinge !
they were via them .
you don &apos;t understand .
we are hobbits !
halblinge !
auenlandbewohner !
maybe you &apos;re that , and maybe you &apos;re not .
the white magician will know .
the white wizard ?
saruman .
see !
see !
we &apos;ve run you !
eilt you , hobbitse .
eilt you !
great happiness we &apos;ve found you .
nice hobbit .
oh !
a moor !
he led us to a sumpf .
a sumpf . yes , yes .
come on , bless .
we bring you to safe pfaden through the fog .
come on , hobbits !
come on !
we go fast .
i found it .
yeah .
the way through the sümpfe .
orks don &apos;t use it .
orks don &apos;t know him .
they go around miles and miles around .
come on , quick !
quiet and fast , how shadow we need to be .
i hate this place .
much too quiet here .
not to hear a bird for two days .
no , no birds to eat .
no knusprigen birds !
we need to starve , yes .
we have to starve , my sweetie .
here .
what is it that they eat ?
is it ... taste it , yeah ?
he &apos;s trying to ersticken us !
we can &apos;t eat hobbit-essen .
we need to starve !
but then verhungere .
then we &apos;re going to go ahead .
oh , grausamer hobbit !
it doesn &apos;t matter whether we &apos;re hungry .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether we need to die .
unlike the lord .
the lord doesn &apos;t care .
the lord knows it .
yeah .
my treasure .
so he einmal the ownership of us , he never lets you go again .
don &apos;t fass me .
there &apos;s dead !
dead faces in the water !
everybody &apos;s dead .
all verfault .
elben and people and orkse .
tremendous battle . long ago .
the totensümpfe .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s your name .
along here .
don &apos;t follow the lights .
otherwise , hobbits go down to the dead and it leaves little candles .
vorsicht now !
frodo !
gollum ?
don &apos;t follow the lights !
gollum !
mr. frodo !
all right ?
beautiful .
so mentors .
oh , my treasure ...
what did you say ?
now , mr. should sleep .
lord must stay in forces .
who are you ?
we can &apos;t ask .
nothing about it .
gollum !
gollum !
gandalf meant you were one of the flussvolk .
cold is hand , heart and gebein . cold , who travels away from home .
he said your life was about a sad story .
he doesn &apos;t see what lies in front of him when sonn ' and moon light versiegt .
you were not so vulnerable at all , right ?
sméagol .
what &apos;s it called me ?
that &apos;s been your name earlier , i &apos;m right ?
a very long time ago .
my name .
sméagol .
black reiter ! hide !
hide !
come on , frodo !
come on !
fast !
you see us .
look at us !
i thought they were dead !
dead ?
no , you can &apos;t kill . impossible .
ghosts !
ghosts with wings !
they call it .
they call them the treasure .
mr. frodo , no fear !
i &apos;m here .
eilt you , hobbits .
the black gate is very close .
orkblut .
these are strange traces .
the air is so stickig here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memories and anger .
the trees , they talk to each other .
gimli !
zügle your ax !
they have feelings , my friend .
it was the elben once ...
they aufgeweckt the trees , and they taught that .
sprechende trees !
what could trees talk about before , huh ?
except about the nature of eichhörnchendreck .
there &apos;s something out there .
what do you see ?
the white wizard , he &apos;s approaching .
you cannot let them speak to him , otherwise the magic gets us .
we need to be geschwind .
you &apos;re tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they ?
they &apos;re durchgekommen here . the past day .
they met someone they didn &apos;t expect .
do you tröstet that ?
who are you ?
show you !
that &apos;s impossible .
verzeih me .
i was given you for saruman .
i &apos;m a saruman .
probably more , saruman , how it should be .
you &apos;re like .
through fire ... and water .
from the deepest dungeon to the top of the summit , i fought against the balrog of morgoth .
until finally , i niederwarf and his containment against the side of the mountain .
then umfing me , and i irrte around without thoughts and zeitgefühl .
and over me , the stars moved over and every day was as long as a lebensalter on earth .
but it wasn &apos;t the end .
because life rührte into me .
i got sent back to my job .
gandalf .
gandalf ?
yeah ...
that &apos;s how you used to call me .
gandalf , the gray one .
that was my name .
gandalf !
i &apos;m a gandalf , the white one .
and i went back to you at the base of the tides .
a etappe of your journey is over , now the next one .
war has come over rohan .
we need to go to edoras , so we can .
after edoras ?
this is not a small distance .
we didn &apos;t hear good about rohan .
it &apos;s bad about king .
yes , and it &apos;s not going to be easy to kurieren .
just say we &apos;ve gone all the way for free ?
should we leave the poor hobbits around here in this grässlichen , dark , dumpfigen , baumverseuchten ...
i mean , wonderful , wonderful forest ?
it was more than pure coincidence that led merry and pippin to fangorn .
many years ago , there &apos;s a big power here .
this is from merry and pippin , like the fall of little rocks that are in the mountains in the mountains .
in one point , you don &apos;t have changed , dear friend .
huh ?
you &apos;re still talking to rätseln .
something is happening in the term that hasn &apos;t happened since the altvorderenzeit .
the ents will become an awakening .
and notice that they &apos;re strong .
big ?
oh , that &apos;s good .
so , it &apos;s going to stop with the ärgerei .
merry and pippin are in safety .
in fact , they &apos;re a lot more than you &apos;re going to be soon .
this new gandalf is still a mürrischer than the old one .
this is one of the mearas , unless my eyes are being fooled by a magic .
schattenfell .
he &apos;s the fürst of all rösser and me through many risks a treuer friend .
eberesche .
erstrahltest once in the bill
the summer wonderfully wonderfully wonderful .
on your haupte , you hold a red and gold .
so you trugst the kron .
that beautiful verse .
is it very far ?
bararum .
not so hastig .
you may call it a long way .
my home is deep in the forest , near the roots of the mountain .
i promised gandalf that nothing happened you and what i promise .
i think the next one is going to be like you .
it &apos;s a eigenkomposition .
so ...
it träumt the laub in the canopy .
life cells , branch and branch .
when schattig moss is green and cool .
and the west wind invites one .
how do i miss you ?
how do i miss you ?
and say , this country is mine .
oh .
schlaft , little auenländer .
don &apos;t hear a nächtlich sound .
schlaft to morgenlicht .
i have now to do in the forest .
it &apos;s true to call a lot .
many people have to come .
a shadow is on fangorn .
näher all the forests .
the threat of shadow , which is lauert in the east , is now taking shape .
sauron will not tolerate rivals .
from the height of barad-dür , his eye wakes up unablässig .
but it &apos;s not so powerful yet that it &apos;s erhaben .
forever , the doubt of it .
he &apos;s heard rumors .
the legacy is alive .
sauron fear you , aragorn .
he fear what you might be .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to zuschlagen the world quickly .
it &apos;s going to be sarumans to vernichten rohan .
there will be war .
rohan has to defend , and there is our first challenge , because rohan is weak , and it &apos;s just in front of the case .
the king thought is enslaved , a very old trick .
its impact on king théoden is very strong now .
sauron and saruman are now moving the schlinge .
but as much as they may be , we have an advantage .
the ring remains hidden .
and that we could try to destroy it , and you don &apos;t think of it in your darkest dreams .
and so the weapon of the enemy rückt gene .
in the hand of a hobbits device , it &apos;s closer to the flames of the schicksalsberges .
we need to trust now .
all of it depends on it quickly , and that his project is secret .
you can &apos;t regret to get away .
he alone has to end up with this task .
he &apos;s not alone .
sam is at him .
oh , actually ?
oh , actually ?
good .
yeah . very good .
the black door of mordor .
oh , stand at us .
my old ohm would have a lot to say if he could see us now .
the gentleman said , show him the path to mordor .
the good sméagol does . the gentleman said ' .
you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s what i guess was ' .
we never get there .
see !
the gate !
it opens up !
here &apos;s a way down .
sam , no !
my lord !
you don &apos;t have to come with me , sam .
i know mr. frodo .
even our elbenmäntel will not be able to protect us inside .
now !
no !
no , mr. !
you get you !
you get you !
don &apos;t bring it to him .
he wants to have it , the treasure .
it &apos;s always on search for it .
and the honey really wants to go back to him .
but we can &apos;t let him get the honey .
no !
there &apos;s another way !
a geheimeren .
a dark way .
and why did you never talk about it before ?
because the lord didn &apos;t ask anything .
it leads to what &apos;s going on .
you say there &apos;s a way to mordor ?
there &apos;s a path and stairs .
and then a tunnel .
he took us so far , sam .
mr. frodo , no !
but he &apos;s got a eid geschworen .
no .
show us the path , sméagol .
good news is always helping .
hello ?
baumbart ?
where is he ?
i had a wonderful dream tonight .
from such a big grain full of pfeifenkraut .
and we have all weggeraucht .
and then you get bad .
what would i spend now for ' nen nen alter .
did you hear that ?
there was ' over there .
here &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
and what &apos;s wrong here !
you &apos;ve just said something on baumisch .
no , no .
i just gereckt myself .
you &apos;re bigger .
' who ?
you go !
what ?
as i !
i &apos;ve always been bigger than you .
pippin , it really knows everybody , i &apos;m the big one , and you &apos;re the small one .
i urge you , merry !
how big are you ?
three ft six ?
allerhöchstens .
whereas i &apos;m just three ft seven .
three ft eight !
3 ft eight .
you did something .
merry , you ...
m ... d ...
merry !
no , baumbart said you don &apos;t drink it !
i want what !
he said it could be dangerous !
go ahead , give it off !
merry !
what &apos;s going on here ?
it has my leg !
merry !
no !
help !
hinfort with you !
you shouldn &apos;t be awake .
eat earth .
grave deep .
trink water .
go sleep .
hinfort with you .
come on . the forest is in the awakening .
this is not safe .
the trees have become wild and dangerous .
anger gärt in their hearts .
black is their thoughts .
strong is her hatred .
they &apos;re malignant if they can .
well , there are too few of us ents .
too few to be done with them .
if you live that long , why are there just so few of you ?
is there ent-kinder ?
burárum .
enttings has no longer given it for a long number of years .
why not ?
we lost the entfrauen .
i &apos;m sorry .
how are they dying ?
died ?
no !
we lost them .
and now we can &apos;t find them .
you didn &apos;t happen to see entfrauen in the auenland ?
i can &apos;t say that honestly .
you , pip ?
what do you see ?
well , i can &apos;t remember .
edoras and the golden hall meduseld .
there &apos;s théoden , king of rohan , whose mind is zerrüttet .
sarumans einfluss on king théoden is very strong now .
my lord , your son , he &apos;s dead .
my lord ?
uncle ?
don &apos;t you want to get him ?
don &apos;t you want to do anything ?
be careful what you &apos;re saying .
don &apos;t expect you to be here .
he probably has to be different during the night .
as tragic for the king , the only son and erben .
i know that goodbye is not easy to add .
in particular , there &apos;s your brother down there .
let me , snake !
but you are alone .
who knows what you &apos;re doing of the darkness , in the bitter hours of the night , if your whole existence seems to shrink .
you have the walls of your own gemachs gemachs in a cage like wildes getier .
so beautiful , so cool ...
like a blasser morning in the spring , durchhaucht of winterkälte .
your words are like poison .
in every cemetery , the mood is happy .
ah !
so i &apos;m not allowed to bewaffnet you to king théoden vorlassen , gandalf graurock .
on geheiß schlangenzunge .
your staff .
huh ?
oh ...
you don &apos;t want to take an old man , you know ?
my gebieter , gandalf , the gray one , is eingetroffen .
he &apos;s a vorbote of the suffering .
the höflichkeit in your hall has a little nachgelassen , théoden king .
he &apos;s not welcome .
why would i welcome you to be heißen , gandalf ?
this is a very berechtigte question , mister and gebieter .
it &apos;s an hour later that this magician enters the agenda .
you should call it láthspell !
bad news is a bad gast .
schweigt !
behaltet your split tongue behind your teeth .
i didn &apos;t go through fire and death now , and now i have verlogene words with a einfältigen worm .
his staff !
i have you befohlen , the magician reduces his staff !
théoden , thengels son ! too long you have a shadow .
i &apos;m not going to go into your place now .
stop me !
i &apos;m going to befreie you from the magic .
you don &apos;t have power here , gandalf , the gray one .
i &apos;m going to saruman you like poison from a wound .
wait !
when i go , then théoden dies .
you didn &apos;t kill me , you &apos;re not going to kill him .
rohan is mine .
soft !
i know your face .
éowyn .
éowyn .
gandalf ?
now breathe the fresh air , my friend .
dark , my dreams were lately .
your fingers would better remind your old strength if you put your sword .
i always serve you , my lord !
your schöpfende heilkunst would almost have led me to crawl into all four of the four , like an animal !
don &apos;t send me from your side .
no , my lord !
let him go .
enough blood has already been vergossen .
i go out of my way !
heil , théoden , king !
where is théodred ?
where is my son ?
simbelmynë .
it &apos;s been growing on the hügelgräbern of my ancestors .
now it &apos;s supposed to cover the grave of my son .
that these evil days must be mine .
the boys die and the old sticks .
i still live and see the last days of my house .
ihr death doesn &apos;t blame her .
no father should wear his child .
he was strong in life .
his soul will find the way to the halls of your fathers .
they were not warning , were unbewaffnet .
now , wild people are moving through the westfold and burn everything down .
stall , schober and tree .
where is mom ?
scht ...
this is just a taste of the schreckens , the saruman heraufbeschwört .
the horror is still wirkungsvoller , because saruman is driven by fear sauron .
riding and he &apos;s offering his forehead .
lockt it away from your wives and children .
you have to fight !
you have 2,000 capable of men who are reiten in this moment .
éomer is true to you .
they will go back and fight for their king .
they &apos;re now going to be 300 miles away from here .
éomer can &apos;t help us .
i know what you &apos;re expecting to do , but i don &apos;t want a vermehrtes sorry under my people .
i don &apos;t want to risk an open war .
open war is before you want to risk it or not .
as far as i can remember , théoden , not aragorn , king of rohan .
and what &apos;s the king decision ?
há há há
we &apos;re looking at zuflucht klamm .
don &apos;t appreciate you .
just look at the nötigste .
helms klamm !
they escape the mountains , even though they &apos;re going to stay here and fight .
who will defend them if not your king ?
he &apos;s just doing what he affected for his people .
helms klamm has been saving it earlier .
from this schlucht , no way out .
théoden runs into a trap .
he believes to bring his people to security .
but it will end up in a gemetzel .
théoden has a strong will , but i fear it .
i fear the survival of the survival .
he &apos;s going to need you in front of the end , aragorn .
the people of rohan will need you .
your defense has to be standhalten .
it &apos;s going to hold .
the gray pilger , they used to call me .
now , for 300 people i &apos;ve been on this earth now , and now i have no time .
in luck , my search is not going to be free .
i would like to get my first light to the first light of the fifth day .
sunrise looks at the east .
go .
the hengst is närrisch , herr .
it &apos;s futile .
his name is brego .
he was the horse of my vetters .
brego ?
your name is königlich .
i heard about the zauberkünsten of the elben , but i wouldn &apos;t have expected it to be a waldläufer from the north .
you speak like one of your own .
as a child , i lived in bruchtal . for a while .
this is free .
he saw enough of the war .
gandalf , the white !
gandalf , the narr !
he trachtet me to humiliate with his new discoveries ?
it was three that followed the magician .
a elb , a dwarf and a human being .
you go to horse .
the person ...
was he from gondor ?
no , from the north .
i mean , one of the dúnedain waldläufer , it seemed to me .
dressed ärmlich .
and yet , he wore a strange ring .
two snakes with smaragdenen eyes .
the one verschlingend , the other gekrönt with golden flowers .
barahirs ring .
then gandalf graurock , glaubt inheritance , believed .
the verschollenen king gondors .
he &apos;s a narr .
this is gender erloschen .
that &apos;s insignificant .
human beings are untergehen .
start in edoras .
i &apos;m ready , gamling .
bring me my horse .
this is not going to defeat .
we will go back .
we will go back .
you &apos;re sent to the sword .
the women have learned that those without swords can still die through a sword .
i fear neither death nor pain .
what do you fear , herrin ?
a cage .
to stay behind bars , for habit and high age , and make all the great , big things , große .
you &apos;re a daughter of kings . a schildmaid rohans .
i don &apos;t think that will be your destiny .
théoden won &apos;t stay in edoras .
it &apos;s vulnerable .
he knows that .
he will expect the city to attack .
they escape helms klamm , the great festung of rohan .
it &apos;s a dangerous way to take them through the mountains .
they &apos;re going to be slow .
they become women and children .
send out your warg-reiter !
hey , stinker ! don &apos;t go too far ahead .
why do you do that ?
what ?
you beschimpfst him .
give him scheußliche names .
simple .
because it &apos;s exactly that , mr. frodo .
there &apos;s nothing left in him than lying and verrat .
he &apos;s got it on the ring .
everything else doesn &apos;t care .
you don &apos;t know how he suffered under the ring . he &apos;s still suffering under him .
i want to help him , sam .
why ?
he has to be able to get back to that .
you can &apos;t save him , mr. frodo .
what do you know about that ?
nothing .
excuse me , sam .
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
i have .
it &apos;s the ring .
you still have eyes for him !
i watched you .
you don &apos;t eat anything .
let alone that you schläfst .
he &apos;s been doing it by you , mr. frodo . fight against it !
i know what i do , sam .
the ring has been anvertraut me .
that &apos;s my job !
mine .
my own !
do you hear about it ?
do you know how you anhörst ?
we want it .
we need it .
we have to have it , the treasure .
they stole us the treasure .
garstige little hobbitse .
evil .
tückisch .
wrong !
no .
not the lord .
but my sweetie .
wrong !
they cheat , they cheat , lying !
the lord is my friend .
you don &apos;t have any friends .
nobody likes you !
i don &apos;t listen .
i don &apos;t listen .
you &apos;re a liar and a dieb .
no .
murderer !
go away !
i want to leave ?
i hate you ! i hate you .
where do you be without me ?
gollum !
gollum !
i &apos;ve saved .
i was that .
we have survived . only for me !
this is over .
what did you say ?
the gentleman is now looking at us .
we don &apos;t need you .
what ?
verschwinde and never come back .
no .
verschwinde and never come back .
verschwinde and never come back .
we told him he should walk away !
and then he &apos;s , my treasure !
gone .
gone .
gone .
sméagol is free .
look !
look !
look what sméagol finds !
they &apos;re young .
they &apos;re tender .
they &apos;re nice .
yes , they are .
eat it .
eat it !
you &apos;re doing it with your behavior .
rabbits can only be in a kind of food .
what does it do ?
stupid fetter hobbit !
they spoil it !
what do you spoil ?
it &apos;s not meat anyway .
what would i give for a few tüften .
what are tüften , my sweetie ?
what are tüften ?
huh ?
kar-tof-feln .
you cook them , stampft them , do it in the soup .
delicious , brutzelnde , golden bratkartoffeln and a piece of gebackener fish .
not one like you could say no .
oh , we could .
spoil the nice fish .
give it us , raw and zappelnd .
keep garstige bratkartoffeln !
i &apos;m driving it up .
mr. frodo , where are you ?
who are they ?
bad people .
servant of sauron .
you call them mordor .
the dark schart all heere around .
no longer takes a long time .
he &apos;s ready to be ready .
ready ? what ?
ready for his war .
the last war , which is wird the whole world with shadows .
we should continue .
come on , sam .
mr. frodo !
there !
olifanten !
no one will believe at home .
sméagol ?
we &apos;ve been aufgehalten for a lot too long .
come on , sam .
no !
wait !
we &apos;re innocent wanderer !
there &apos;s no wanderer in this country .
just the servant of the dark turms .
we &apos;re dedicated to a secret mission .
those who claim to be against the enemy would do well to stop us .
the enemy ?
his pflichtgefühl was in nothing for you , i mean .
you wonder how he meant and where he came from .
whether he really had a bad heart .
what lies or drohungen have caused him to the long march from his home .
if he didn &apos;t rather have stayed there . in peace .
the war is making bodies from us all .
tie your hands .
it &apos;s true , many zwergenfrauen , you don &apos;t see .
and they &apos;re also similar to us in the voice and what they &apos;re often holding for male zwerge .
it &apos;s on the bärten .
and then again , the fallacy came out that there &apos;s no zwergenfrauen , and that zwerge just came out of erdlöchern ! which , of course , is ridiculous .
all right , good .
just no panic .
that was intent .
that was intent .
it &apos;s long ago that i saw my niece smile .
she was still a child when she was brought home to her father , from orks .
she watched her mother broke from grief .
and then she was alone and he used her king under a wachsender fear .
it &apos;s verdammt for an old man that you should love to love .
gimli .
uh , no , that ...
thank you ...
i did a eintopf .
it &apos;s not much , but it &apos;s hot .
thank you .
it &apos;s good .
right ?
my uncle tells me something weird .
he said you &apos;re moved to war with thengel , my grandfather .
but he has to be wrong , i think .
the king memory is good .
he was still a little kid .
then you have to be at least 60 .
70 ?
you can &apos;t be 80 .
87. 87. 87.
you &apos;re one of the dúnedain .
a nachkomme of the númenorer who are blessed with a long life .
it means your gender was in the realm of legend .
few of us are left .
the nördliche kingdom was destroyed a long time ago .
sorry .
please , eat .
the light of the abendsterns is not too much .
it belongs to me , i can give it to the who i want .
like my heart .
sleep now .
i sleep .
this is a dream .
then it &apos;s a good dream .
sleep .
you &apos;d say that this day will come .
this is not the end ; it &apos;s the beginning .
you have to go to frodo .
that &apos;s your way .
my path is hidden in front of me .
he &apos;s already stuck on her feet .
eventually you cannot zögern .
arwen ... if you don &apos;t do anything else , vertrau .
where is it ?
the woman who once gave you this schmuckstück ?
our time here is over .
and also arwens time .
let &apos;s move .
let &apos;s go to the ship of the ship .
let your love take your love to the immortal , where it stays forever .
but nothing more than memory .
i &apos;m not going to give you a arwen here .
it &apos;s just here because it has hope .
it &apos;s deinetwegen .
but she belongs to her people .
and so you take a goodbye ?
did you think you could get some signs on the fort table ?
i &apos;m not going to return .
you unterschätzt your kriegsgeschick .
you &apos;re going to return .
i &apos;m not talking about death in the battlefield .
what do you talk about ?
you have the views of another life , weitab of war , mourning , despair .
why do you say that ?
i &apos;m a sterblich .
you elbischen .
it was a dream , arwen .
nothing on .
i don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s yours .
it was a gift .
keep it .
my lord ?
they went to the immortal to the immortal , with all that are left by their people .
what is ?
háma ?
i &apos;m not sure .
warge !
a späher !
what have you seen ?
warge !
they make us reach .
all the rider at the top of the zugs !
so , it lifts me up .
i &apos;m a rider .
forward ! go !
you &apos;ve got to lead people to helms klamm , quickly .
i can fight !
no !
you have to do that . for me .
follow me !
hüa !
forward !
i mean , move forward .
run to the valley !
so !
now !
sit together !
my ax is waiting for your fratze !
it goes to my calculation !
stinkende creature !
aragorn !
aragorn ?
tell me what happened , then i &apos;ll leave you .
he &apos;s dead .
he &apos;s just down there from the cliff .
you lügst !
the verwundeten on the horses .
the wolves will come back .
the dead are here .
come on .
finally !
helms klamm !
we did it .
we &apos;re in safety , herrin !
mom !
éothain !
freda !
where is the rest ?
we couldn &apos;t take it , herrin .
all right , make everything in the caves .
makes room for the king !
power for théoden !
space for the king .
so few .
so few are back .
our people are in security .
we paid for a lot of lives .
herrin .
mr. aragorn ... where is he ?
he &apos;s like .
push all of our troops behind wall !
verriegelt the gate !
post up !
what happens to those who can &apos;t fight , my gebieter ?
with women and children ?
bring it into caves .
sarumans arm has got to be long when he thinks to be able to reach here .
helms klamm has a schwachstelle .
his außenwall is made up of solid rock , but there &apos;s a little durchlass on the bottom , hardly more than a abflussschacht .
how ?
how does fire undermine stone ?
what elixier do you get to get the wall niederzubringen ?
it &apos;s going to be helms klamm .
even if you durchbräche it , an unimaginable number would be vonnöten , thousands , to storms .
tens of thousands .
but , my gebieter , there is no such force .
a new power spreads .
and your victory is close .
tonight , the country becomes befleckt with the blute rohans .
up to helms klamm !
don &apos;t leave anyone alive !
forward !
there is no morning for humanity .
see !
the south goes up smoke .
well , it &apos;s always rising from isengart of those days .
it used to be saruman often in my forests .
now it &apos;s got metal and wheels in the sense .
it &apos;s nothing more about growing living .
what is that ?
this is sarumans force .
the war started .
may the gunst of the valar protect you .
brego .
arwen .
it &apos;s so far .
the ships sail valinor .
now , before it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;ve met my choice .
he will not return to you .
why are you still sitting here if there &apos;s no hope ?
there &apos;s still hope .
if aragorn survived this war , you &apos;ll still be separated .
and if sauron is defeated and aragorn king , and everything that you &apos;re talking about , it &apos;s got erfüllt , and yet it &apos;s going to experience bitter .
whether through the sword or slow decline , one day aragorn .
and no consolation will give you , no consolation , to relieve the pain of its scheidens .
it gets to death . it &apos;s a picture of all the magnificence of menschenkönige in its ungetrübten , before the world broke apart .
but you , my daughter , you &apos;re going to keep on in the dark stages and in doubt like the winter night sky without star .
this is where you &apos;re going to fristen your own existence , gefesselt of grief under the schwindenden trees , so long until the world turned through and all of your life years went extinct .
arwen .
there &apos;s nothing for you , just death .
don &apos;t i have your love ?
you have my love , father .
the enemy is growing .
sauron uses saruman as marionette to vernichten the people .
isengart has shrunk .
now the eye saurons itself on gondor , the last free kingdom of people .
his war against this country is rapidly heraufziehen .
he feels that the ring is close .
the power of ringträgers schwindet .
deep in his heart , frodo starts to realize that the challenge is his life .
you know that .
you &apos;ve chosen it .
we &apos;ve all mentioned that .
in the early days , the will erstarkt the will .
by every prize , he &apos;s looking back to the hands of people , those people , who are making it so light .
the young heermeister gondors needs only to spread its hand to take the ring and the world gets untergehen .
he &apos;s just about to reach his goal .
because sauron is about everything on this earth , even over the end of the world .
the time of elben is over .
are we leaving ourselves ?
let &apos;s put them all down ?
what &apos;s new ?
our späher report that saruman rohan has 89 .
théodens people fled helms klamm .
but our own limitations should be worried about us .
faramir , orks are in the anmarsch .
sauron provides an army .
ostlinge and südländer happen the black gate .
how many ?
several thousand .
every day , more .
who are überwacht the flow in the north ?
500 man from osgiliath .
will be attacked by the city , we will not keep them .
saruman comes from isengart .
sauron of mordor .
people are going to have to fight on both sides .
gondor is weak .
sauron will soon attack us .
and it becomes a hard flick .
he now knows that we don &apos;t have the power to kill him .
my men argue you &apos;re ork-spitzel .
spitzel ?
that should be a joke .
now , if you &apos;re not a spitzel , who are you ?
talk !
we are hobbits from the auenland .
frodo beutlin is my name . and this is samweis gamdschie .
your leibwächter ?
his gärtner .
and where is your schleichender friend ?
this verwahrloste creature ?
you want to say ugly .
we &apos;re on the road alone .
with seven gefährten , we broke on bruchtal .
we lost one in moria . we were four hobbits . it was a dwarf .
and a elb and two people .
aragorn , arathorns son and boromir from gondor .
are you a friend of mine ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got my part .
then you get to know that he &apos;s dead .
dead ?
why ?
when ?
as one of his gefährten , i hoped that she told me .
if something happened to boromir , you have to tell us .
his horn had washed up to the river river , about six days ago .
it was divided in two parts .
but more than that , it tells me my heart .
he was my brother .
boromir !
boromir !
this city once was the jewel of our kingdom .
a hort of light , beauty and music .
and this is what it should be like again .
let &apos;s say the streitkräften mordors .
never again , the country of my people drops in the enemy !
the city osgiliath has been zurückgefordert ! for gondor !
- ! for gondor !
- ! for gondor !
talked good .
nice and short .
that &apos;s the way to drink more time .
the drums angestochen !
the men here are durstig !
merk the day today , little brother .
today life is beautiful .
what ?
he &apos;s here .
not a moment of peace , he can gönnen us .
where is he ? where is he ? where is gondors best ?
where is my erstgeborener ?
dad !
they say , almost in the alleingang , you would have bezwungen the enemy .
overdo them .
faramir did the same thing for victory .
if faramir had done his part , the city would be .
didn &apos;t you have to defend them ?
i survived it , but we were too few .
so , too few ?
you got the enemy to do the city .
how many times don &apos;t you appear to me in a good light .
that &apos;s not my intention .
he tries to be to be to will , and never have you left for him .
he loves you , father !
behellige me not with faramir . i know about his strengths , and it &apos;s not many .
we have dringlicheres to talk .
elrond of bruchtal has a poll .
he doesn &apos;t want to tell why , but i can think of the occasion .
it &apos;s the gerücht , you found the gun of the enemy .
it &apos;s a ring .
isildurs curse .
he &apos;s gone into the hands of the elben .
they all want to be bemächtigen .
people , zwerge , magician .
we can &apos;t let that happen .
this thing has to go to gondor !
- ...
it &apos;s dangerous , i know .
always the ring is going to try to verderben the hearts of shallow people .
but you , you &apos;re strong .
and our distress is big .
it &apos;s our blood that &apos;s been vergossen ; our people that suffers death .
sauron is still going to happen .
it leaves masses of troops .
he will return .
and if that happens , we &apos;re much too powerless to stop it .
you have to go !
bring me this powerful gift .
no .
my place is here , with my people .
not in bruchtal !
do you mind your father ?
it &apos;s necessary to ride for bruchtal .
schicke me .
you ?
ah , i understand .
now faramir , the heermeister gondors , can show what it &apos;s worth .
rather than .
this assignment , i just trust your brother .
one who doesn &apos;t get me down .
merk the day today , little brother .
heermeister faramir !
we found the third one .
you have to come with me .
immediately .
down there .
just come in and look at the verbotenen weiher , the death penalty .
they expect my command .
should i be shooting ?
kühlen woll woll n , we suhlen suhlen
so saftig-süß saftig-süß .
and then there &apos;s a fish coming on the table .
so saftig-süß saftig-süß .
wait !
i &apos;m tied to this creature .
and it &apos;s to me .
it leads us .
please , let me down to him .
sméagol .
the lord is here .
come on , sméagol !
mr. vertrau , yeah ?
come on !
we need to go forward here .
sméagol , you have to trust the gentleman .
follow me .
come on with !
come on .
come on , sméagol !
nice sméagol .
that &apos;s good .
come on !
don &apos;t hurt him !
sméagol , don &apos;t fight .
vertrau me !
my lord !
that &apos;s enough .
tell me where you hinführst them .
tell me !
sméagol .
why is sméagol crying ?
cruel people are going to hurt us .
lord reingelegt us .
of course he did .
i told you that it &apos;s tückisch .
i told you that he &apos;s wrong .
lord is our friend .
our friend !
lord tells us .
no !
no matter .
let &apos;s stay alone !
dirty little hobbitse .
they stole him !
no .
no !
what have you stolen ?
my treasure !
we have to disappear here .
go .
go , go !
you can do that .
use the ring , mr. frodo .
just this time !
sit down .
become invisible .
i can &apos;t .
you were right , sam .
you wanted to warn me , but ...
i &apos;m sorry .
the ring of me arrest me , sam .
when i aufsetze him , he finds me .
he sees it .
but , mr. frodo ...
so , this is the solution to all of the puzzles .
here in the wild , i have two halblinge , and a flock of people under my command .
and the ring of power is totally close to me .
now faramir , the heermeister gondors , can show what it &apos;s worth .
no !
stop !
let him quiet .
don &apos;t you find that ?
he must destroy him !
and we did . we go to mordor .
the feurigen mountain !
osgiliath is under beschuss .
they call them amplification .
please !
he &apos;s carrying such a load .
you must help him , please .
heermeister ?
we break up .
the ring will go to gondor .
he &apos;s alive !
where is he ?
out of the way !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m teaching .
you &apos;re the schlaueste , the gerissenste , the really tollkühnste who ever met me .
be blessed !
gimli , where is the king ?
you come late .
you look terrible .
heerscharen , do you tell ?
ganz is geräumt .
how many ?
10,000 head strong , at least .
10,000 ?
it &apos;s an army , gezüchtet for one purpose .
vernichten the world of people .
if you break the night , you &apos;re here .
let them come .
it &apos;s every man and every kräftige knabe , which is waffenfähig , bis the night .
we can make the dammweg and the tor of above .
no army ever has the klammwall durchbrochen or a foot in the hornburg .
this is not a bande hirnloser .
these are uruk-hai .
their rüstungen are thick and their schilde are wide .
i gefochten a lot of wars , herr zwerg .
i don &apos;t know to defend my own festung .
they &apos;re going to branden to the festung like water on rock .
sarumans horden are being rape and brandschatzen , but we &apos;ve seen that before .
crops can be built new , building houses .
within those walls we will survive .
they don &apos;t want to destroy rohans fields or villages .
they want to eradicate rohans people until the last child .
tell me what to do .
you see my men !
your kampfgeist is almost erloschen .
if this is our end , then i want to make it a end of what everybody remembers !
schickt reiter , sir !
you need to pay attention to support .
and who will come ?
elben ?
zwerge ?
we are glückloser with our friends than they are .
our old bündnisse are history .
gondor is going to help .
gondor ?
where was gondor when the westfold fell ?
where was gondor , when our enemies jumped the circle around us ?
where was gon ?
no , my lord aragorn , we &apos;re alone .
bring the women and children into caves .
we need more time to standzuhalten a siege .
théoden : we don &apos;t have time .
we &apos;re in the war .
hold the door !
we &apos;ve been ents for a long time here , not to take people &apos;s wars and zauberern .
but now something happens , which has not happened since an age .
entthing .
what should that be ?
a gathering .
a gathering of what ?
birken .
eichen .
kastanien .
eschen .
good .
good .
good .
many have come .
now we need to decide whether to pull the ents into war .
hurry you !
keep on , people !
eilt you !
we postieren the second series along the river .
that &apos;s the way the bogenschützen is supporting above the tors .
aragorn , you have to rest .
you &apos;re not halblebendig .
my lord , aragorn !
i organized women to join the caves .
a ehrbare task .
to look at the kids , to be concerned for food and beds of men ?
that &apos;s all other than ruhmreich !
my herrin , it will soon be necessary without fame .
so , who will your people look at the last defense ?
let me stand on your side .
it &apos;s not in my power to say that .
you don &apos;t know the other one .
yet , they &apos;re fighting next to you because they don &apos;t want to be separate from you .
just because they love you .
i &apos;m sorry .
farmers , hufschmiede , stallburschen .
these are not soldiers .
most of them have seen too much in winter .
or too few .
look at you !
they fear .
i see it in your eyes .
and it &apos;s about 300 .
against 10,000 !
there &apos;s more hope for you , if you &apos;re defending here , instead of edoras .
aragorn .
you can &apos;t win that fight .
you &apos;re all going to die !
then i &apos;m going to die as one of them !
leave him , boy .
let &apos;s give it .
every villagers who can run a sword was sent to the waffenkammer .
my gebieter ?
who am i , gamling ?
you &apos;re our king , bless .
and are you familiar with your king ?
your men , lord , follow you at jedwedem end .
to jedwedem end .
where are reiter and ross ?
and the horn , which is widely hallende ?
long , how rain in the forest passed .
and wind in the branches .
in the shadow behind the mountains , the days in the west .
how could it come so far ?
huh ?
it &apos;s been going on for hours now .
you &apos;ve got to have something now .
decided ?
no .
we &apos;re just finished fertig .
but now it &apos;s already in the middle of the night .
you can &apos;t leave your time forever .
not so hastig .
now we don &apos;t have time anymore .
go hurry .
give me your sword .
what &apos;s your name ?
haleth , hámas son , my lord .
the men say we &apos;re not going to be überstehen night .
they say it &apos;s hopeless .
this is a good sword .
haleth , hámas son . hope is always there .
we always trusted you .
you &apos;ve never met us .
verzeih me .
i couldn &apos;t have any doubt .
there &apos;s nothing too surprising , legolas .
if we had time , i would change this thing .
it &apos;s a little eng around the chest .
this is not a ork-horn .
send the king .
open the door !
opens the door !
how is that possible ?
i teach kunde from bruchtal .
once there was a bündnis between elben and people .
a long time ago , and we died side .
this is bündnis now .
you &apos;re truly welcome .
moving back to the battle with people , erfüllt us .
you could actually choose a better place .
well , boy , whatever you &apos;re lucky , may outlive the night .
your friends are with you , aragorn .
you also like überdauern the night .
doesn &apos;t show any erbarmen , because you &apos;re not going to know anybody .
what happens out there ?
well , i could describe it to you .
or should i get a box ?
hold one !
so it starts .
bereitmachen !
her armor is weak at the neck and below the arm .
arrows go !
have you met anything ?
sends a pfeilhagel .
arrows !
arrows !
send me to me !
go ahead .
ladders !
good !
schwerter !
schwerter !
legolas !
i &apos;ve got two .
i &apos;m at 17 . -- what ?
huh ? i &apos;m not going to let myself down from a spitzohr . hua !
19 !
merry !
we just agreed .
yes ?
i said , &quot; you know , i said , &quot; you &apos;re not orks . &quot;
that &apos;s a good news .
but what about saruman ?
have you made a decision , what does it concern him ?
not too hastig , my lord meriadoc .
hastig ?
our friends are out there !
you need our help !
you can &apos;t win that war alone .
war ?
yeah .
he &apos;s all about us .
tree , root and branch .
but you &apos;ve got to know , young hobbit , that it takes a lot of time to say something in the old entisch , and we only say something if it &apos;s worth it , so much time .
17 !
18 !
19 !
20 !
21 !
the dammweg !
is that all ?
these are your zauberkunststücke , saruman ?
put it in , legolas !
kill him ! kill him !
stop the gate !
wehrt them off !
bleibt !
aragorn !
gimli !
attack !
the ents can never avert this storm .
we wittern things like we &apos;ve always done .
it can never and nimmer your decision .
this is not our war .
but you &apos;re part of the world !
or not ?
you need to help .
please !
you have to do something .
you &apos;re young and tapfer , mr. merry .
but your role in this story is over .
go home again .
maybe baumbart is right .
we &apos;re not sitting here , merry .
that &apos;s too big for us .
what can we do about it ?
we have the auenland .
we should go home .
the fire isengarts will spread and the forests of buckelstadt and bockland are burning .

in the south , we can vorbeischlüpfen by unbemerkt .
the closer we are the danger , the less it can happen to us .
that &apos;s the last thing he does .
mw : well , it doesn &apos;t sound very obvious to me .
on the other hand , you &apos;re very small .
maybe you &apos;re right .
yes , so to south .
hold , little auenländer .
south i always like to go .
somehow you feel that you go downhill .
are you crazy ?
they get us there .
don &apos;t .
this time not .
see !
osgiliath burns .
mordor has come .
the ring will not save gondor .
he only has the power to destroy .
please go .
quick !
faramir !
you have to let me go .
mmh , a few feldmäuschen that climb sometimes up to me and tickle me .
on the allerwohlsten , you feel when you ...
many of these trees were my friends .
creatures that i knew of nuss and acorn .
i &apos;m sorry , baumbart .
they had a voice .
saruman !
a magician had to have more minds !
there &apos;s no curse on elbisch , entisch or in the languages of people for such a verräterei .
see !
the trees !
they move .
where do you want to go ?
you have something with the orks .
my job tonight is isengart , with rock and stone .
yeah .
hrumm , hrumm , comes , my friends .
the ents are moving into war .
it &apos;s probably the path of our untergangs .
the last march of ents .
faramir , the orks have taken the ostufer .
they &apos;re far too abundant .
we &apos;re overwhelmed with the night .
mr. frodo ?
he calls him , sam !
his eye quickly captured me .
hang on , mr. frodo .
you can do that .
bring her to my father .
he says faramir sends a powerful gift .
a weapon that &apos;s going to turn our skill into this war .
do you know what happened to boromir ?
why your brother died ?
he had a eid geschworen to protect frodo , and then he tried to boil his ring down .
he wanted to kill him !
because of the ring your brother was wahnsinnig !
give eight !
mr. frodo ?
you &apos;re here !
they &apos;ve come .
nazgûl !
there it is .
don &apos;t leave you from the spot .
deckung .
the festung is taken .
it &apos;s over .
her sagtet , the festung would never fall , as long as your people verteidigten them .
they &apos;re still defending them .
they made their lives .
they break through !
they &apos;re off the gate !
is there no other way for women and children out of the caves ?
is there no other way ?
there &apos;s a path .
it goes to the mountains .
but far they don &apos;t come .
the uruk-hai are too abundant .
all women and children are supposed to go on the gebirgspfad .
und the entrance !
so much death .
what can the person do against such tollkühnen hatred ?
riding out with me .
riding out and fight !
for death and glorie !
for rohan !
for your people !
the sun goes up .
i would like to get my first light to the first light of the fifth day .
sunrise looks at the east .
yeah .

what do you intend ?
where do you want to go ?
i &apos;m a ' .
i , your sam .
don &apos;t you mind your sam ?
i don &apos;t schaff that , sam .
i know .
that &apos;s all wrong .
in fact , we shouldn &apos;t be here , in this place .
but we are here .
this is like in the big stories , mr. frodo .
those who were really important .
full of darkness , they were .
sometimes you didn &apos;t want to know the end , because , how could a story look good ?
how could the world be again as if so much of it happened ?
victory !
we have gesiegt !
even the darkness has to have soft .
a new day will come .
and if the sun appears , it will seem brighter .
these were the stories that stay in mind that were significant .
even if you were too small to understand it .
but i think mr. frodo , i understand now .
i know now .
people in these stories have always been able to reverse the opportunity , just didn &apos;t do it .
they went on because they believed anything .
what should we believe , sam ?
there &apos;s something good in this world , mr. frodo .
and it &apos;s worth fighting .
i think now we understand each other , frodo beutlin .
you know the laws of your country , the laws of your father .
if you run it , your life is verwirkt .
then it &apos;s verwirkt .
let them go free !
not in the woods .
hold away from the trees .
i count exactly .
42. -- 42 ?
oh , not so bad for a spitzohriges elbenprinzlein .
i gave a seat to the number of 43. .
43. 43. .
it was dead .
he has gezuckt .
he has gezuckt , because i pushed him my ax between his nervenstränge !
it doesn &apos;t look very happy , what ?
all right , merry .
still , you &apos;ve got a lovely view of this up there .
oh yeah .
a erstklassig geführtes house .
the butler should be great .
what do you do ?
nothing .
everything is the way it should be . nothing .
not quite .
i have a mordshunger .
that &apos;s where we have to be lucky if we want to find some essbares .
and there &apos;s ' , just dead rats and schimmeliges bread .
sarumans vorratskammer !
i don &apos;t traue my eyes !
that &apos;s not true .
yeah , it &apos;s !
langgrundblatt !
feinste pfeifenkraut in südviertel .
that fits exactly .
a barrel for each of us !
wait !
should we be baumbart what ?
no .
no .
dead plants and all that .
i don &apos;t think he would have to understand it .
he could be a entfernter relative .
oh , i understand now .
not so hastig .
exactly .
barrumm !
this is the old channel .
it goes underneath the river to the outskirts of paris .
the forest will give you protection behind it .
heermeister faramir , you &apos;ve shown what you are worth , ok .
the allerhöchste .
the auenland must be really prachtvoll , mr. gamdschie , where gärtner are high in honor .
what kind of path do you get when you hit the forest ?
gollum says there was a path near minas morgul , which goes up into the mountains .
cirith ungol ?
isn &apos;t that his name ?
no . no .
yeah !
frodo -- it &apos;s called a dark schrecken in the pässen above minas morgul .
you cannot go to this path !
there &apos;s no other way .
the gentleman told us it has to be mordor , so we have to try it .
i have to .
go , frodo .
the good wishes of all people .
thank you .
may cruel death ereilen you , you should be sorry .
come on , don &apos;t trödle .
mr. frodo didn &apos;t want the waldläufer to hurt you .
you know , right ?
he wanted to save you , do you understand ?
saving me ?
so not nachtragend .
pardon and forget ?
no , no , no , not nachtragend .
gollum . gollum .
nice gentleman .
nice hobbits .
very bad from you .
really cute , gollum .
saurons anger is going to be terrible , its vergeltung .
the battle of helms klamm is over .
the battle of mittelerde has only begun .
our hope lies with two little hobbits , somewhere in the wild .
i &apos;d like to know if we ever have in songs or in stories .
what ?
i wonder if people ever say , let &apos;s hear about frodo and the ring .
i say , yes !
this is one of my favorites .
frodo was very tapfer , i &apos;m right , dad ?
yeah , my boy .
from all the most famous ones .
and that tells a lot .
but one of the hauptfiguren you left out .
samweis , the beherzten .
tell us more about sam .
frodo would not have come far .
oh , mr. frodo , you &apos;re funny about me .
i was serious .
i &apos;m also serious .
samweis , the beherzte .
sméagol ?
we &apos;re not waiting for you !
come on .

we could let them do it .
yes , she could do it .
yeah , my sweetie , she could .
and we take it when they &apos;re dead !
once they &apos;re dead .

go long away .
sméagol shows you the path .

we need to go !
we need to break instantly .
didn &apos;t you sleep at all , mr. frodo ?
i do too much .

the pökelfleisch is exquisitely good !
pökelfleisch ?
hobbits ! we unterstehen the command ! he &apos;s the new stewards of isengart .
young master gandalf !
i &apos;m happy about yours .
wood and water , stick and stone can be beherrschen .
but here it is being done with a magician , locked in its tower .
and there needs to be saruman , bewacht , baumbart .
let &apos;s turn it down to the head , finally .
no !
his power is versiegt .
the dirt is sarumans .
trees are going to come back to live here .
young trees .
wild trees .
in my borke !
peregrin tuk !
i &apos;ll take that , my boy .
go !
today we honor those who gave their blood to defend this country .
heil the cozy dead !
heil !
i &apos;m looking forward to you .
he &apos;s a ruhmreicher man .
you &apos;re both ruhmreiche men .
not théoden from rohan has led our people to victory .
don &apos;t listen to me .
you &apos;re young .
and today &apos;s day is true .
you can search for ' all the year and nothing better .
because no way the beer tastes as good as it does at home .
behaltet bock and ale , verschließt the edlen !
because , the real zier , i tell you this .
is the green dragon hopfen !
thank you .
no news from frodo ?
no word .
nothing .
we have time .
every day , frodo gets closer to mordor .
do we know that ?
what does your heart tell you ?
that frodo is alive .
yeah .
yes , he &apos;s alive .
too dangerous .
too dangerous .
diebe !
they stole him .

not verderben it now .
but you know .
they greet us !
what does that mean , my honey , dear ?
is it about nerves ?
no .

never !
sméagol hates garstige hobbitse .
sméagol , she sees at the allerliebsten ... dead .
and we will .
sméagol did it already .
he can do it again .
he &apos;s our !
our !
we have to zurückholen the treasure !
patience !
patience , my rather .
we need to get them first .
we lead them to the gewundenen staircase .
yes , the staircase .
and then ?
up , up , the staircase up , until we come to the tunnel .
and when they get inside , they don &apos;t come out again .
it &apos;s always hungry .
it always needs food .
eat it .
it &apos;s just getting dirty orkse .
and it &apos;s not delicious , what , honey ?
no .
not delicious at all , my rather .
it &apos;s lust meat .
hobbitfleisch .
and if you wegwirft the bones and the left , you find it .
and then he belongs to me !
we .
yeah , we said we were .
gollum ...
gollum !
the honey will be our , once the hobbitse are dead !
you hinterhältiger smaller ...
no !
no !
lord !

i heard it from his own mouth .
he wants to kill us ! never !
sméagol wouldn &apos;t have any fly to do .
the widerliche , fats hobbit can &apos;t suffer sméagol , so he invents a secret .
you elende little made !
i grab your skull .
sam !
you &apos;re the liars !
if you verjagst it , we &apos;re lost !
i don &apos;t care .
i can &apos;t wait for him to kill us , mr. frodo !
i can &apos;t wegschicken it !
you don &apos;t know what ?
he &apos;s a schurke !
we can &apos;t do that alone , sam .
not without a leader .
i need you on my side .
i &apos;m on your side , mr. frodo .
i know , sam .
i know .
vertrau me .
come on , sméagol .
the stars are verhüllt .
something happens in the east .
a schlaflose bosheit .
the enemy of the enemy is approaching .
what are you doing ?
pippin !
pippin !
pippin !
are you mad ?
i just want to look at it .
a allerletztes time .
put it back .
pippin !
no !
pippin !
he &apos;s here .
i see you !
pippin !
help !
gandalf !
help him !
pippin !
närrischer tuk !
look at me !
gandalf . verzeih me .
look at me !
what did you see ?
a tree ...
a white tree in a steinernen farm .
he was dead .
the city burned .
minas tirith .
did you see that ?
i have ...
i saw it .
i could hear his voice in my head .
what did you say to him ?
talk !
he asked my name .
i didn &apos;t respond .
he has wehgetan me .
what did you tell him about frodo and the ring ?
it wasn &apos;t a lie in pippins eyes .
a fool , but a honest narr remains .
he has nothing about frodo and the ring .
we &apos;ve had strange luck .
pippin could get an insight in our enemy plans .
sauron does an attack on the city of minas tirith .
his enemy at helms klamm has shown one thing .
that elendils legacy is hervorgetreten and people aren &apos;t so weak .
they have courage , and perhaps force enough to challenge him .
sauron fear that .
the people mittelerdes together , they won &apos;t risk .
in fact , he makes minas tirith the ground as the return of a king on the throne of people .
if the leuchtfeuer gondors are angezündet , it has to be rohan kriegsbereit .
tell me why should we contaminate those help that have failed us ?
what are we attacking ?
i &apos;m going to go .
no ! you have to be warning !
you will .
you have to take a different way to minas tirith .
follow the river and stick for the black ships .
one must be aware .
well , something is underway that can &apos;t be done .
i reite for minas tirith , but not alone .
from all the naseweisen hobbits , peregrin tuk , you &apos;re the worst .
faster !
where do we go ?
why have you geguckt ?
why would you always have to look at everything ?
i don &apos;t know .
i couldn &apos;t be different .
you can never .
i &apos;m sorry , yes ?
i don &apos;t do ' .
don &apos;t you even have a clue ?
the enemy believes you have the ring .
he will look for you , pip .
you have to fortschaffen yourself here .
but you come with me ?
merry ?
come on now !
how far is minas tirith ?
a dreitagesritt , like the nazgûl flies .
let us hope that we don &apos;t have any of those of us .
here .
a little bit on the road .
the rest of the langgrundblatt !
i know you don &apos;t have any more .
you rauchst too much , pip .
but we &apos;re going to see ourselves soon ?
right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
merry !
run , schattenfell . show us what a coin means !
merry !
merry !
led it to sicherstem .
in the gray hemisphere , a ship is vor .
it &apos;s waiting to carry you across the sea , the last trip of arwen undómiels .
there is nothing for you . only death .
woman arwen ! we &apos;re not allowed to stay .
herrin !
tell me what you &apos;ve seen .
arwen . you have the gift of the voraussicht .
what did you see ?
i saw in your future geblickt and death .
there &apos;s life there .
you &apos;ve seen a child there .
you &apos;ve seen my son !
this is the future of schwindet .
but it &apos;s not lost .
there is nothing .
some things are certain .
if i leave him now , i &apos;m going to forever regret .
it &apos;s time .
out of ashes , the fire is hit , and shadow comes out of light .
heil sword schwert sword
and king who lost the crown .
schmiedet the sword .
your hands are cool .
the lebenshauch of the eldar leaves you .
this was my decision .
you know , whether you want it or not , there &apos;s no more ship that can fortbringen me .
we &apos;ve just entered the kingdom .
minas tirith .
the city of kings .
out of the way !
that &apos;s the tree .
gandalf !
gandalf ! yes , the white tree gondors .
the tree of the king .
but mr. denethor is not the king .
he &apos;s just truchsess , hüter of the throns .
now , listen to me .
mr. denethor is boromirs &apos;s father .
he was überbringen the message of his son &apos;s death .
and you don &apos;t mention frodo nor the ring .
and you don &apos;t say anything about aragorn .
and the best thing you &apos;re doing is not just the mouth , peregrin tuk .
heil , denethor , ecthelions son , mister and truchsess of gondor .
i come with a message in this dark hour and with advice .
maybe it comes lhr to explain that .
maybe it comes lhr to explain why my son is dead .
boromir dropped to save us , my vetter and me .
as he suffers against enemies .
pippin !
what i can do to service , let me offer you to this guilt .
stand up .
my lord , the time , boromir to betrauern , will give it , but it &apos;s not now .
war pulls up .
the enemy is in front of you .
as a result , lhr are lhr with the defense of this city .
where are gondors troops ?
you have friends .
you &apos;re not alone in that fight .
benachrichtigt théoden of rohan .
entzündet the leuchtfeuer !
you think it &apos;s wise .
but you don &apos;t have wisdom in all your ingenuity .
do you want the eyes of the white turms to be blind ?
i &apos;ve seen more than you know .
you want to use me as a sign for mordor .
and with the right you trachtest to deny me .
i know who &apos;s riding with théoden von .
oh yeah .
i heard about this aragorn , arathorns son .
i &apos;m going to tell you , you know , a waldläufer from the north of the north , i don &apos;t think of it as the last one of a zerlumpten house , has been beraubt for a long time .
you &apos;re not empowered to refuse the king , truchsess !
the rule of gondor is my ! and no other !
come on !
that &apos;s probably a zeremonielle post .
they hardly expect me to fight .
or yet ?
you &apos;re now in the service of truchsess .
you &apos;re going to do what you &apos;re doing .
peregrin tuk , wächter of the veste .
it &apos;s so quiet .
this is the deep luftholen luftholen .
i don &apos;t want to stand in any battle , but waiting for one that you can &apos;t avoid , is even worse .
is there even hope , gandalf ? for frodo and sam ?
it never had a lot of hope .
just a fool could hope .
our enemy is ready .
all its forces are gathered up .
not just orks , but also people .
heerscharen from the south .
söldner from shore , they &apos;re all going to be able to make a call .
that will be the end of the way we know it .
this is the hammerschlag hammerschlag am .
if the river is taking off , when the crew falls in osgiliath , this city is no longer defending .
but we have the white wizard .
that must be good for anything .
gandalf ?
it hasn &apos;t sauron his country tödlichsten diener , who is going to lead the mordors forces in war .
those of you who mean , no living man can kill him .
the hexenkönig of angmar .
you &apos;ve met him once .
he &apos;s got frodo on the wetterspitze .
he &apos;s the fürst of the nazgûl . the top of the nine .
minas morgul is his seat .
the dead city .
very bad place .
full of enemies .
fast .
fast !
you see us otherwise !
come on !
see ! we found it .
the path to mordor .
the secret staircase .
climbing !
no ! mr. frodo !
not long .
what does it do ?
no ! you call me . no !
hide ! hide !
i can feel his blade .
this is the hour of the great battle of our time .
come on , hobbits .
we need to climb !
the checkerboard is set .
the characters are in motion .
peregrin tuk , my boy , there &apos;s something to do .
once again , a auenländer can provide its high value .
you can &apos;t let me down .
quiet .
the river !
quick !
further , further .
faster !
schwerter .
amon dîn .
the leuchtfeuer !
the leuchtfeuer of amon dîn is angezündet !
hope schimmert .
the leuchtfeuer of minas tirith !
burning the leuchtfeuer !
gondor ersucht for help !
and rohan will afford .
let &apos;s go to the heerschau !
gathered the army in dunharg .
so many men , as you can find .
you have two days .
in third , we ride to gondor and to war !
gamling !
eilt through the riddermark .
calls all the tauglichen men to dunharg .
do you ride with us ?
just to feldlager .
it &apos;s practice that the women at hofe are leaving men .
the men found their heermeister .
they will follow you in the battle , even in death .
you &apos;ve given us hope .
so before the walls of minas tirith , the fate of our age is supposed to be .
here &apos;s the hour .
reiter of rohan , eide , have their geschworen .
now , all of you .
for mr. and country !
faramir !
we can &apos;t standhalten them .
the city is lost .
give up positions .
we go to minas tirith .
nazgûl .
give up the post !
retreat !
retreat to minas tirith !
retreat !
retreat !
the era of people is over .
the time of orks has come .
the white rider !
pull !
mithrandir !
they have our defense durchbrochen .
they &apos;ve taken the bridge and the westufer .
ork-verbände are on the river .
how mr. denethor prophezeite it !
long , he saw this decline ahead .
and yet he was frowning !
faramir ?
this is not the first halbling to check your way .
no .
you saw frodo and sam ?
where ? when ?
in lthilien .
no two days ago .
gandalf , they take the road into the morgul-tal .
and then the passport of cirith ungol .
what does that mean ?
what have you ?
faramir , tell me everything .
vorsicht , bless .
here you go very deep .
very dangerous is the staircase .
come on , bless .

and i &apos;m not going to forget about it nor versäumen , to vergelten , which is given .

eidbruch with punishment .
we should have the outer verteidigungs -- not so leichtfertig , which held your brother so long .
what do you want me to do ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the river in pelennor .
osgiliath must be zurückerobert .
osgiliath became überrannt .
a lot has to be dreamed of war .
is there a heerführer that has the courage to fulfill the wish of his lord ?
you wünschst , our places were vertauscht . that i was dead and boromir alive .
yeah , i wish that !
because you &apos;re boromirs beraubt , i want to do what i &apos;m going to do instead of .

how should i show my treue if not ?
your father loves you , faramir .
before the end comes , it will remind you .
can you sing , mr. hobbit ?
well , yeah .
well enough for my own people at least .
but we don &apos;t have songs for large halls and bad times .
why should your songs be inappropriate for my halls ?
come on , sing me .
home verblasst , rückt the world .
with a lot of pfaden , it &apos;s there .

without gunst , without ...
gunst .
march !

for the king !
my lord !

grimbold , how many ?
about 500 men from westfold .
we have 300 more from the fenmark , théoden king .
where are the rider from the schneeborn ?
it &apos;s not a eingetroffen , sir .
6,000 spears .
less than half as much as i erhoffte .
6,000 will not be enough to break the positions .
it will get more .
with every lost hour of gondors defeat .
we wait until the tomorrow graut , we have to ride .
the horses are rastlos and the men schweigsam .
the schatten of the mountain worries them .
this road there , where does it go ?
this is the road to dimholt , to the gate under the mountain .
no one who hinbegibt there comes back .
this mountain is evil .
aragorn !
let &apos;s look for what to eat .
there .
a true knappe rohans !
i &apos;m ready !
verzeiht .
in particular , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not even sharp .
that &apos;s not good .
many orks are not killing lhr with stumpfer blade .
come on !
to schmiede !
go !
you shouldn &apos;t encourage him .
you shouldn &apos;t doubt him .
i don &apos;t zweifle on his heart , just on reach of his arm .
why would you leave merry ?
he &apos;s also got a lot of reason to ride into the battle of how you do .
why can &apos;t he fight for those fighting he loves ?
and so i choose a sterbliches life .
i would have seen him last time .
mr. ?
king théoden would expect you , lord .
i get back .
my lord elrond .
i &apos;m going to show you one that i love .
arwen is dying .
for a long time , it becomes the evil , which is now from mordor heraufzieht , not survival .
the light licht verblasst .
it &apos;s like saurons power , so it schwindet its power .
arwens life is tied to the fate of ringes .
the shadow is about us , aragorn .
the end has come .
it &apos;s not going to end our end , it &apos;s being .
you go to war , but not in the victory .
saurons forces march to minas tirith , you know .
but he &apos;s going to send a kriegsmacht that &apos;s going to be made by the river .
a flotte flotte segelt segelt from the south .
in two days they are in the city .
you have a übermacht against you , aragorn .
you need more men .
there is no .
there are those who are the mountains .
murderer . verräter .
you want to go to fight ?
they believe nothing .
don &apos;t follow anybody .
the king of gondor will follow you !
andúril , the flame of the west , geschmiedet out of the pieces of narsil .
sauron won &apos;t have forgotten the sword elendils .
the blade , the broken ward , will return to minas tirith .
who can lead as powerful sword , can also create a force that is deadly than any on this earth .
leave the waldläufer behind you .
mind your destiny .
suggest the road to the dimholt .
i give people hope .
i don &apos;t keep hope for me .
why do you do that ?
the east is going to lead .
they &apos;re not fortgehen at the battle of battle .
you cannot let the men down .
éowyn ...
we need you here .
why come in ?
don &apos;t you know that ?
it &apos;s just a shadow and a thought that you love .
i can &apos;t give you what you &apos;re looking for .
where do you want to go ?
this time you have to leave behind , gimli .
have you ever heard anything about the sturheit of the zwerge ?
think about it .
we come with you , boy .
what &apos;s happened ?
where is he going ?
i don &apos;t realize that .
mr. aragorn !
why is he going to the battle of battle ?
he &apos;s because there &apos;s no hope anymore .
he &apos;s because he has to .
too few people have come .
we can &apos;t defeat the forces .
no , we can &apos;t .
and nonetheless , we &apos;re going to see them in the battle .
i &apos;ve left instructions .
thou shalt herrschen by the people instead of the people .
take my place in the golden hall .
long , you mögest edoras when the battle becomes lost .
what other duty want to be auferlegen to me , sir ?
pflicht ?
no .
i just want you to lächelst again and not for those of you who have come out of time .
you &apos;re going to experience hellere days and no despair .
what is the army holding to this place ?
one , which is cursed .
once again , the people of gebirges the last king of gondor is a eid , in the case of the struggle .
but when time came and gondor was at the highest level , it was flohen and verbargen in dark places in the mountains .
it &apos;s so verfluchte , they &apos;re never going to be quiet until their eid is full .
even the warmth of my bluts seems to have davongestohlen .
the path is versperrt .
he was designed by those who are dead .
and the dead hold it .
the path is versperrt .
brego !
i &apos;m not afraid death .
this is unerhört !
a elb goes below the earth and a dwarf , not ?
you &apos;d be in the ears forever .
we ride with little load and fast .
it &apos;s a further way .
man and animal can still fight if they &apos;ve let it come .
little hobbits are not in the war , mr. meriadoc .
all my friends moved into the fight .
i would be ashamed of myself .
it &apos;s a dreitagesritt after minas tirith .
you &apos;d be just a burden for my rider .
i want to fight !
this is my last word .
riding me .
herrin !
formiert you !
break out !

ride now to gondor !
who enters my rich ?
one who challenges your lehnstreue .
the dead people don &apos;t tolerate the living ones here .
i will tolerate lhr tolerate .
the path is versperrt .
he was designed by those who are dead .
and the dead hold it .
the path is versperrt .
now you have to die .
i urge you to fulfill your eid !
nobody , except the king of gondor , will give me commands .
this blade broke .
it was neu .
fight for us and get your honor back .
what does lhr say ?
what does lhr say ?
you vergeudest your time , aragorn .

the top shirt owns me .
this comes to the great eye with everything else .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about stinkigen morgul-ratten .
if you anrührst it , i put this blade in the wanst !
the drecksack wanted to abstechen me !
kills him !
this is for frodo !
and for the auenland .
and this is for my old ohm .
stop quieken , you misthaufenratte .
bleed will be like a abgestochenes pig !
not when i get to you before .
sam !
oh , sam , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
let &apos;s get out here .
too late .
it &apos;s over .
they took it .
sam , you took the ring !
i &apos;m sorry , but you don &apos;t .
i thought i &apos;d lost you .
so i took him .
it &apos;s just to verwahren him .
give him me !
give me the ring , sam .
sam !
give me the ring .
knowing that .
the ring is my load .
it will vernichten you , sam .
come on , mr. frodo .
let &apos;s look for some clothes .
you can &apos;t walk through a walk with nothing on your skin .
we did it , mr. frodo .
we &apos;ve reached mordor .
it &apos;s so many of you .
we never come through .
it &apos;s it . the eye .
we have to go through , mr. frodo .
it &apos;s not different .
come .
let &apos;s just start with the mountain for the beginning .
i won &apos;t see frodo in the distance .
the darkness takes off .
if sauron would have the ring , we would know .
that &apos;s just a matter of time .
he has suffered a defeat , yes , but behind the walls of mordors erstarkt our enemy .
he should stay there .
verfaulen !
why should we care ?
because 10,000 orks are now between frodo and the schicksalsberg .
i sent him to death .
no .
there &apos;s still hope for frodo .
it takes time and a safe way across the plane of gorgoroth .
we can help it . how ?
we &apos;ve got to herauslocken saurons force so that he entblößt his country .
then we put our entire power up and march to the black gate .
we can &apos;t do that by waffenstärke erringen .
not for us .
but we can support frodo when saurons eye stays on us when we make sure that he &apos;s blind to everything else that moves .
a distraction .
sauron becomes a trap .
he &apos;s not going to let himself ködern .
death as a sense . less sense of success . what are we waiting for ?
to the gates , your lame sacks !
move you !
to the gates !
look ! orks ! they pull off !
you see , mr. frodo ? finally , a little luck .
take mine .
some drop are still inside .
now there &apos;s nothing for the return path .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a return driver , mr. frodo .
frodo , down !
hide you !
frodo !
where are they ?
the black country is supposed to be heraustreten !
he &apos;s going to get his gerechte punishment !
back . back .
it &apos;s continued , mr. frodo .
the light is moving north .
something abgelenkt his gaze .
hold your seat !
sons gondors and rohans , my brothers !
in your eyes , i see the same fear that i &apos;m taking .
the day it may come , because the guts of people versiegt , because we let our gefährten go down and bande all the friendship .
but this day is not today .
the stunde of the wolves is ' &apos;s and zerschmetterter schilde , because the age of people untergeht .
but this day is not today .
today we &apos;re fighting !
in everything that &apos;s expensive on this good earth , i &apos;m going to tell you : hang on , people of the west !
never would i have thought i &apos;d die page with a elb kämpfend .
and side side with a friend ?
yeah .
i could .
do you remember the auenland , mr. frodo ?
there &apos;s spring soon .
then blühen the obstbäume .
and the birds are building nests in the haselnussdickicht .
and they &apos;re going to aussäen the sommergerste on the lower fields and the first strawberries to eat with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
no , sam , i don &apos;t have a reminder of food , the sound of the water or the sound of the water .
i &apos;m nude in the darkness .
there &apos;s nothing , no veil between me and the feuerrad .
i can see it . my eyes are eyes .
let &apos;s finally get rid of it . one for all time !
come on , mr. frodo .
i can &apos;t wear it for you , but i can wear you !
come on !
aragorn .
elessar !
for frodo .
there , mr. frodo .
a entrance .
we &apos;re almost there .
smart hobbits , so high climbing .
frodo !
eagles !
they breed !
frodo !
here i am , sam .
trash him !
do it ! now !
remove it into fire !
what are you waiting for ?
just let it go !
the ring belongs to me !
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
darling !
darling !
darling !
darling !
give me your hand .
take my hand !
no !
just don &apos;t go .
don &apos;t go .
greif !
frodo !
frodo !
it &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s done .
yeah , mr. frodo .
now it &apos;s over .
i can see the auenland .
the brandyweinfluss .
beutelsend .
gandalfs fireworks .
the lights at the festbaum .
rosie hüttinger dancing .
she was wearing loops in the hair .
if i ever had one married , she &apos;d been ' .
she &apos;d been ' .
i &apos;m happy to be with you , samweis gamdschie , here at the end of all things .
gandalf ?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
you might be glückselig .
this day is not a single man , but all of us .
let &apos;s rebuild the world together so we can share them in friedenszeiten .
my friends , you don &apos;t mind anyone .
and so a third age broke in mittelerde .
the community &apos;s community , although forever , is connected to friendship and love , organized .
on the day 13 months after gandalf sent us on the long trip , a conscious sight offered us .
we were at home !
warning , kürbis !
rosie , rosie !
good night , guys .
how do you make a living life ?
how do you keep doing it when you get deep in your heart , that there &apos;s no way back ?
some things can &apos;t cure time , some pain that &apos;s too deep and a umklammert .
mr. frodo ?
what is ?
four years has passed since the day on wetterspitze , sam .
it &apos;s never really verheilt .
the story of a hobbits of bilbo beutlin and the lord of frodo beutlin
you &apos;re done .
not quite .
it &apos;s another place for a little more .
bilbo told me that his role in this story is that we all have to show up and disappear .
bilbos history was now over .
for him , there would be no travel anymore to one .
tell me another time , my boy . where do we go ?
zum , bilbo .
the elben give you a special honor : a place on the last ship , leaving the mittelerde .
frodo ? could i even see my old ring ?
the one i gave you ?
sorry , uncle .
i &apos;m afraid i lost it .
shame .
i &apos;d like to put it in your hand last time .
this is a photograph i didn &apos;t have in my life .
the power of three rings has a end .
time has come to the rule of people .
the ocean will call us home .
i think i &apos;m beautifully equipped for another adventure .
you know , my brave hobbits .
my work is done .
so here , on the banks of the ocean , the end of our community comes .
i don &apos;t want to say weinet , because not all tears are übel .
it &apos;s so far , frodo .
what does he mean ?
we are losgezogen to save the auenland .
and it &apos;s been saved .
but not for me .
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s serious .
you can &apos;t fortgehen !
the last pages are for you , sam .
my rather sam !
you cannot always be entzweigerissen .
you &apos;re going to have to be all the whole and the gadgets .
there &apos;s so much that you &apos;re excited about what you can be and do .
because your role in history continues , sam .
yeah . i &apos;m back .
my lieber .
you asked me if i told you all stories about my adventure .
and i can say to you the truth always .
so i didn &apos;t tell you anything .
i &apos;m now old , frodo .
i &apos;m not the same hobbit i used to be .
i think it &apos;s time for you to erfährst what really happened .
it started a long time in a country in a country , and a country , like you don &apos;t find it all over the world today .
there was the city there .
with their long and wide known markets .
crops and wine in hülle and fülle .
peaceful and affluent .
because this city was in front of the shanghai kingdom in mittelerde .
erebor .
bergfestung of thror , the king under the mountains , the most powerful of all zwergenfürsten .
thrors rule was unangefochten . he never zweifelte his house on his house , he was gesichert his son and his grandchildren .
oh , frodo , erebor .
deep inside the mountain , the beauty of this festungsstadt was legendär .
their wealth was in the soil , in kostbaren edelsteinen , beaten out of the rock , and in huge goldadern , like rivers across the rock .
the skills of zwerge were looking for everyone , and they created objects of the number beauty of diamonds , smaragden , rubinen and saphiren .
they killed deeper in the darkness .
and there they found him .
the heart of the mountain .
the arkenstein .
thror called him the königsjuwel .
he saw him as a sign to be the auserwählte king .
all huldigten him .
even the big one .
elbenkönig , thranduil .
as the wealth of the zwerge grew , their good will increases .
nobody knows exactly what the zerwürfnis triggered .
the elben say the zwerge would have stolen their sweetie .
the zwerge say the elbenkönig would have suffered their legal share .
it &apos;s sad , frodo , how old arrangements break , how to be lost between people .
and what ?
schwermut durchzog the days and mistrust trübte the nights .
thrors love for gold had become übermächtig .
a disease started growing in him .
a disease of mind .
and where disease is , it becomes very bad consequences .
the first thing you heard was a sound like a wild storm , which is from north heranbrauste .
the kiefern on the berghängen krachten and zerbrachen in the hot , dry wind .
balin , alarm alarm .
call the police station .
immediately !
thorin , what is that ?
a kite .
dragon !
it was a feuerdrache from the north .
smaug had come .
death was gnadenlos on that day .
the menschenstadt had nothing .
he had a different prey apart .
because gold weckt a dark , wildes desire .
ah !
no !
fast , come on .
erebor was lost .
because a kite bewacht his prey as long as he lives .
run your life !
ah !
help us !
thranduil didn &apos;t want to expose the life of the dragon to the dragon .
from the elben , there was no help that day , and no other day since .
their homeland beraubt , durchstreiften the zwerge from the erebor , the wild . once a powerful people was kraftlos and entmutigt .
the young zwergenprinz took every work he could find .
but he never forgot the smoke of the mountain in the mondschein , the bergwald , the bright night .
because he had seen the fire of the dragon in the sky and cities that were asche .
and he never forgot and never forget .
far away , in another end of the world , kites were only a fantasy .
they fly .
move from zauberern to festen .
not furchterregender than feenstaub .
bilbo !
and at this point , my rather favorite thing , i get to play .
bilbo !
not .
it was the beginning of an unprecedented friendship that mein my entire life .
but that &apos;s not the beginning of my story .
for me , she started ...
well , she started to figure out how to do it .
in a hole in the ground , there was a hobbit .
not in a feuchten , dirty hole full of worms and modergeruch .
no , the hole was a hobbithöhle , and that means good food .
thank you .
what is that ?
that &apos;s personal .
take your curious pfoten away .
it &apos;s not finished yet .
ready ? what ?
to read it .
what , in all the world , is this ?
answers to the invitation .
oh .
you my goodness .
is this today ?
everybody agreed .
except for the sackheim-beutlins . they want you to be einlädst .
so , do you want that , yes ?
only about the only thing about it .
you probably would be right .
my body .
they seem to believe that you have gold in the abundance .
a little box that &apos;s not übergequollen .
and they still stink for troll .
what , in all the world , are you doing it ?
i meet vorkehrungen .
i &apos;ve caught it when she wanted to leave the silver mitgehen .
who ?
lobelia sackheim-beutlin .
she had gestopft all my spoon into her pocket .
ha !
terrible frauenzimmer .
versprich me to have an eye on her when i ...
if i ...
if i ...
if you do what ?
oh , nothing .
nothing .
you know , some of you are thinking about you , uncle .
what ?
you know , you &apos;re going to be wunderlich .
wunderlich ?
oh . mmm .
and it &apos;s not umgänglich .
not umgänglich ?
i ? unfug .
it &apos;s so good , and it häng out the door .
do you think he &apos;s coming ?
who ?
gandalf .
oh , yeah .
it doesn &apos;t make it round up to fire its zauberknaller .
this becomes a real artifact . you &apos;re going to see .
all right .
i have to go .
where ?
the forest in ostviertel .
i want to surprise him .
well , just with you .
you still get too late .
he doesn &apos;t like it when you get too late .
oh no . not that i &apos;d ever come too late .
at that time i was always on time .
i was through rechtschaffen .
and it never happened anything unexpected .
nice good morning .
what does that mean ?
do you want me a good morning , or do you think it &apos;s a beautiful morning , no matter what i wish ?
or your wolltet say that you can find everything that morning and good ?
or you say , you need to be good at this morning or be beautiful ?
huh ?
all at the same time , i suppose .
yeah .
can i help you ?
that &apos;s where we go .
i &apos;m fighting an adventure , and i &apos;m looking for someone who &apos;s going to go .
an adventure ?
i don &apos;t think any western of bree has a lot of interest in abenteuern .
you have nothing to do with anger and scherereien .
and you get too late to eat .
ha , ha .
mhm .
really ?
yeah .
oh .
ah .
good morning .
i &apos;m going to abgewimmelt from belladonnna sohn &apos;s son with a good morning as if i sell buttons at the door .
how ?
you &apos;ve changed you . and not only for better .
bilbo beutlin .
excuse me , i know you ?
well , you know my name , even though you don &apos;t know to me .
i &apos;m a gandalf .
and i &apos;m gandalf .
gandalf ?
the old tuk went to each sommersonnenwende eins .
ha . um .
no idea you &apos;re still in the business .
and where else should i be ?
well ...
ähem .
well , i &apos;m glad you know something else about me , and if it &apos;s just my fireworks .
yeah .
that would be decided .
it &apos;s going to do very well , and it will be very belustigend for me .
i &apos;m going to share it to the other .
tell , who ?
what ?
no .
no ...
wait .
we have no use of adventure , at all .
neither today , nor ...
i propose you &apos;re trying to do it behind the bühl or beyond the wässer .
good morning .
tomorrow !
that &apos;s like that . please .
a beautiful day .
chum .
hello , mr. bilbo .
here , they feel like my knollen .

who said ?
yeah .
yeah .
very good that .
is there more ' ?
what ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
ah .
here , please , use you .
well ...
it &apos;s just that i didn &apos;t necessarily expect society .
that &apos;s probably the door .
balin . in your service .
good evening .
yeah .
yeah , he &apos;s good .
although i think it might rain afterwards .
am i getting too late ?
too late , what ?
oh !
ha , ha !
evening , brother .
in my barte , you &apos;ve become shorter and bigger for the last time .
wider , not shorter .
and even smart enough , for both of us .
uh , sorry , sorry .
i just hate , but i &apos;m not quite sure you &apos;re in the right house .
have you ever eaten ?
so , actually , i didn &apos;t go to visit . i guess , like any other hobbit .
but more than that , i appreciate it before he &apos;s visiting me .
what is that ?
no idea .
you should be cheese .
it &apos;s very blue .
wimmelt .
it &apos;s like , i don &apos;t know you both .
not at least .
i don &apos;t want to be rude , but that had to be said .
believe -- i &apos;m sorry .
sorry .
oh .
go full , brother . not so knickrig .
let &apos;s taste it .
i could eat what if you get on it .
fili .
kili .
in your service .
you must be mr. beuteler .
no !
you can &apos;t come in .
this is the wrong house .
what ?
is it abgesagt ?
we don &apos;t know anything about that .
it wasn &apos;t really abgesagt .
i &apos;m relieved .
careful with that .
i just geschliffen them .
beautiful house . very nice here .
yeah .
did you build it yourself ?
what ?
no , it &apos;s been in familienbesitz .
this is the aussteuertruhe of my mother .
would you please leave that ?
fili , kili , comes .
put it on .
mr. dwalin .
ha , ha .

everybody ?
how many are there ?
where does it go ?
oh , no .
the thing is really hard .
no .
no .
it &apos;s no one at home !
just go again , belästigt someone else .
it &apos;s too many zwerge in my dining room .
if any holzkopf allows you to joke a joke , i can only say it &apos;s very geschmacklos .
gandalf .
sorry , that &apos;s my chicken .
um ...
and if you don &apos;t please ...
and this is my wine .
i have to ask .
he says he feels slightly uncomfortable .
because a hand axe in his head ?
verreckt ?
no , it just brummt the skull .
his legs are still healthy .
think back .
put it back .
put it back .
not the marmelade .
sorry .
sorry .
ein übertrieben , right ?
have you a käsemesser ?
käsemesser ?
he &apos;s eating him all over .
oh .
no . this is opa mungos chair .
no , and also .
bring it back , please .
i can &apos;t hear what you say .
a antiquität , not to sit .
this is a book , no untersetzer .
and let the card back please .
excuse me , mr. gandalf ?
yeah ?
would i be poisoning you to a tässchen kamillentee ?
oh , no , thank you , dori .
a gläschen red wine would like me .
caution .
oh .
yeah .
uh , fili , kili .
uh ...
oin , gloin .
dwalin , balin , bifur , bofur , bombur .
dori , nori , ori !
no .
not my preisgekrönten tomatoes .
no , thank you .
yes , you have absolutely right , bifur .
a dwarf is obviously lacking .
he just verspätet .
he was walking north to meet our sippe .
it will come .
mr. gandalf ?
a gläschen red wine , like desire .
he has a fruchtiges bouquet .
oh .
good news .
i think we should start . bombur eat his second lammkeule .
yeah .
never .
not from the distance .
do we want to make mistakes ?
you wirfst like a girl .
ah , you ungeschickter !
who wants a beer ?
please .
i want one , brother .
i said , trink still .
drink out , three !
one , one .
two ... two ...
prost !
i knew what &apos;s inside you !
sorry , this is a spitzendeckchen and no geschirrtuch .
but there are holes in there .
that &apos;s true too .
this is geklöppelt .
oh , nothing goes about a good klopperei . if you cast the right shot .
that you verhageln the bärte , this zwergen !
i &apos;d rather bilbo , what &apos;s going on in the world ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m surrounded by zwergen .
what do you want this ?
they &apos;re a very muntere gathering when you get used to them .
i don &apos;t want to get used to them .
look what my kitchen looks like .
the carpet is full of mud .
the speisekammer is geplündert .
from the bathroom to silence .
you &apos;ve got that as well as kaputtgemacht .
i don &apos;t realize what they want in my house .
i &apos;m sorry , if i give you , but what do i do with my plate ?
all right , ori , give it to me .
tragt that back .
entschuldigt times .
that &apos;s the good westviertel-geschirr of my mother .
this is over 100 years old .
and , do you mind ?
you make it stumpf .
oh , guys , have you heard ?
he said the knife are becoming stumpf .
schlitzt the tischtuch of damast
now , in fire , the old cork .
werft the glasses on the wall
what bilbo beutlin does .
hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates hates
spritzt the wine to every door .
the fat stampft the fat .
tränkt die gut with beer .
cut out the bones .
unters bett bed .
we zerkleinern with the hand hand .
pots , bowls , porzellan
and then it &apos;s still another .
something variable heil .
let &apos;s start from the front of the line .
what bilbo beutlin hates hates .
so , bilbo ?
he &apos;s there .
gandalf .
didn &apos;t you say that this place was easy to find ?
i got lost . 2-mal .
without the sign of the door , i couldn &apos;t have found ' at all .
sign ?
there &apos;s no sign .
it was just taken out a fresh way ago .
there &apos;s a sign .
i used it myself .
bilbo beutlin . can i introduce you to the leaders of our unternehmung ?
thorin eichenschild .
so , that &apos;s the hobbit .
is , mr. beutlin , are you in the fight ?
right ?
ax or sword ?
what &apos;s your weapon ?
i throw a very elegant rosskastanie , if you want to know it , but i don &apos;t know how that should be meaning .
i thought i was ' .
more than a krämer than a meisterdieb .
everybody came ?
yeah .
abgesandte of all seven königreiche .
sounds vielversprechend .
and what have the zwerge said from the eisenbergen ?
does it include us ?
they won &apos;t come .
they say this journey is our thing . thorin : our own .
you go to a journey ?
bilbo , my dear friend , could we probably have more light ?
far in the east , behind gebirgen and rivers , beyond woods and ödland , there &apos;s a single , entlegener mountain .
the lonely mountain .
oin has gedeutet the signs , and the signs is , the time is ripe .
you saw raben that zurückflogen the mountain as it was geweissagt .
and when the birds go back to the age of age , the vögel will end up by the bestie .
uh ... what bestie ?
fliegender feuerspucker .
teeth like rasiermesser and claws like fleischerhaken .
with a predilection for edelmetall .
yeah , i know what a kite is .
i &apos;m not afraid .
i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m going to do that , which is a zwergenklinge , right in his allerwertesten .
right , ori !
and also , with an army in the back would be hard enough , but we &apos;re just 13 .
sit down .
neither 13 of the best ones nor the smartest .
hey , do you get about stupid ?
excuse me , what did he say ?
we don &apos;t like to be very many , but we &apos;re kämpfer . fili : each of us .
and don &apos;t forget , we have a wizard in our rows .
gandalf has already killed hundreds of dragons .
oh , well , no .
i wouldn &apos;t say ...
how many then ?
what ?
how many dragons have you killed ?
there we go .
call us a number .
sorry .
please .
if we recognize the signs , then you don &apos;t think others can see ?
the rumors is already spreading .
the dragon drache was not for 60 years .
looking at the region of the east , the mountain , abschätzend , überlegend , the risk .
the vast wealth of our people is perhaps there .
let &apos;s just see how others are getting , what are we going to do ?
or do we take that opportunity and bring us back to the erebor ?
you remember , the haupttor is locked .
there &apos;s no way in the mountain .
that , my rather balin , is not quite true .
how did you come to him ?
your father anvertraut him .
thrain .
i should verwahren him .
he &apos;s listening to you now .
if there &apos;s a key , there &apos;s a door .
these runen have a secret rail to the lower halls .
there &apos;s another entrance .
when we find it , geschlossen are invisible .
the solution is hidden in this map , except i don &apos;t own the ability to find them , but there are others in mittelerde that can do that .
the truth i imagine is based on heimlichkeit , and i need a certain amount of courage .
but if we &apos;re careful and smart , i think we can do it .
that &apos;s why we need a meisterdieb .
yeah .
that &apos;s a good one .
the best , i want to think .
and , are you ?
am i what ?
he said he &apos;s the best .
hey .
what , i ?
no .
i &apos;m not a dieb .
i &apos;ve never stolen anything in my life .
well , i &apos;m afraid i have to agree with mr. beutlin .
it &apos;s not carved from diebesholz .
no .
yes , the wild is not a place for good people to fight nor to fight .
that &apos;s what he gets . look at him .
enough !
if i say that bilbo beutlin is a meisterdieb , he &apos;s a meisterdieb .
hobbits are remarkable leichtfüßig .
basically , they come to almost every ungesehen , if they want .
and while the dragon zwerge without any other wittern , the smell of a hobbits is as good as unknown for him . what gives us a critical advantage .
i should find the vierzehnte member , and i decided to do mr. beutlin .
in him , there &apos;s more than you can guess , and a lot more .
as he ahnt himself .
you have to trust me .
all right .
so , let &apos;s do ' .
-- no , no .
give him the contract .
here we go .
that &apos;s the usual one .
zusammenfassung , hours of labor , fee , begräbniskosten , and so on .
begräbniskosten ?
i can &apos;t guarantee for safety .
i understand .
i &apos;m still responsible for his destiny .
fair enough .
conditions : conditions .
zahlung at delivery , gewinnbeteiligung a vierzehntel of the gesamtprofits .
hmm .
it seems appropriate .
the unterzeichner are not haftbar for zugefügte , including ergebende injuries , including not entirely platzwunden , but not entirely platzwunden .
ausweidung ...
combustion ?
well , he schmilzt one in the handumdrehen of the bone .
all right , smaller ?
what ?
yeah , go .
just a little bit schwummrig .
imagine a winged schmelzofen .
yeah , i have to get to the air .
yeah .
no .
oh , very helpful , bofur .
it goes right again .
i just want to rest , a moment .
you &apos;ve got a lot of time off .
tell me , when are the spitzendeckchen and your mother &apos;s worth of your mother so important ?
i remember a hobbit , which always ran on the road for elben through forests .
the long time , the long time , came to the dark , covered by mud and bits , followed by fireflies .
a young hobbit who would not have done anything rather than to explore what lies behind the boundaries of the auenlands .
the world is not in your books and maps .
it &apos;s out there .
i can &apos;t just go into the blue open .
i &apos;m a beutlin from beutelsend .
you &apos;re also a tuk .
you know your ururururonkel .
bullenrassler tuk was so big that he could ride on a right horse ?
yeah .
yeah , it could .
in the battle of grünfeld , he went into the rows of the orks .
he schwang his club with such force that he abschlug the head of the head , which then flew 100 times through the air and fell into a kaninchenloch .
that &apos;s how the battle won .
and it was invented by the same time .
you just came up with this .
all good stories deserve to be ausgeschmückt .
you &apos;re going to have some to tell you if you &apos;re zurückkehrst .
can you promise me that i get back ?
no .
and if yet , you will be another one .
i thought .
sorry , gandalf , i &apos;m not unterzeichne .
you have the wrong hobbit .
obviously we lost our meisterdieb .
probably better .
our chances were never good .
and finally , who are we ?
kaufleute , bergarbeiter , kesselflicker , spielzeugmacher .
ha , ha .
not the fabric , from the legend .
there are some warriors among us .
old warrior .
i would prefer every single one of these zwerge to an army from the eisenbergen .
because when i called them , they were .
treue , honor , a kämpferherz .
i can &apos;t ask anything more .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
you have a choice .
you were always ehrenhaft to our people .
you &apos;ve allowed us to have a new life in the blue mountains .
life in peace and abundance .
a life that is worth more than anything in the erebor .
from my grandfather , this is what came to me .
they träumten from the day that the zwerge erebors erebors their home .
there &apos;s no choice , balin .
not for me .
then we stand in , boy .
we will do it .
about talking about about above .
the nebelberge .
to caves deeply deeply .
from age time .
there &apos;s ' n coming out there .
lockt profits .
through wind and weather , through wind .
not and suffering .
and where knisternd knisternd .
in the gehölz
a brand fire .
of winds .
angefacht angefacht angefacht
the sky is red .
the flame loht .
bergwald befackelt befackelt befackelt
bright the night .
hello ?
yeah .
yeah .
mr. bilbo , what &apos;s the holidays for ?
no time , i &apos;m too late .
too late , what ?
i get into an adventure .
i said ' .
did i not say ' ?
come on pure time .
that &apos;s true though .
närrischer thought , a mitzunehmen ride .
whose idea was that actually ?
wait !
wait !
wait , wait .
whoa , whoa .
i signed up .
here .
it seems to be all right .
welcome , master beutlin , in the community of thorin eichenschild .
give him a pony .
no , it won &apos;t be necessary .
thank you .
i can certainly keep on on foot .
because i &apos;ve been making a lot of moves , you know ?
even up to froschmoorstetten .
ah !
come on , nori .
pay .
please .
thank you , my boy .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , you &apos;ve completed a bet if you &apos;re auftauchst or not .
most people bet , you wouldn &apos;t do it .
what did you believe ?
oh ...
my dear friend , i don &apos;t have gezweifelt to you .
oh , pferdehaare .
not so well .
no , wait , wait , stop .
stop !
we need to reverse .
i forgot my taschentuch .
here .
take that .
and further .
you &apos;re going to have to do without taschentücher and lots of other things , bilbo beutlin until we &apos;re at the end of our journey .
your home is the gentle hills and small rivers of the auenlandes .
but home verblasst .
and the world is close .
hi , my little .
this is a braves girl .
that &apos;s what our little secret is , myrte .
not telling .
psst , psst .
what was that ?
orks .
orks ?
halsschlitzer .
dozens of them out there .
in the empty land , it &apos;s all about you .
they &apos;re just going to break off when everything is sleeping .
fast and silent , nobody &apos;s screaming .
very much blood .
do you think that &apos;s fun ?
do you hold a ork-angriff at night for a joke ?
we didn &apos;t think about it .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know about the world .
don &apos;t take ' übel , my boy .
thorin has more reason than most people to hate orks .
after the dragon gerissen the lone mountain , king thror challenged the ancient zwergenreich moria .
but our enemy was already there .
moria was taken by ork-scharen , led by the abscheulichsten of her whole people .
azog , the schänder .
the giant gundabad ork had geschworen , durins gender auszulöschen .
first , he enthauptete the king .
no !
thrain , thorins father , trieb the sorrow .
it was caught or killed , no one knew .
he disappeared .
we were without leaders .
defeat and death came over us .
yeah , and then i saw him .
a young zwergenprinzen who offered the bleichen ork .
he left this horrible widersacher .
with zerfetzter armor , nothing as a eichenast in your hands .
azog , the schänder , got to feel that day that the gender durins is not so easy to overcome .
our troops gathered up and kept the orks back .
our enemy was defeated .
but not surprisingly , we , and no songs we sang in this night , because too many deaths we had to complain .
few of us had survived .
and then i said to myself , this one wants to follow one .
this one i can call king .
and the bleiche ork ?
what has it become ?
he zurück into the hole that he came from .
this trash , a long time ago , is verreckt to his wounds .
mr. gandalf , could you do something about these überschwemmung ?
it &apos;s raining , meister zwerg , and it &apos;s going to weiterregnen until it stopped to rain .
want to change the weather in the world , you need to look for another magician .
what ?
what ?
other magicians ?
there are five of us .
the highest of our ordens is saruman , the white one .
and then there &apos;s two blue magicians whose name i have forgotten .
and who is the fifth ?
oh , of course , this is radagast , the brown .
is he a big magician , or is it more like you ?
i think he &apos;s a very big magician . he &apos;s in his way .
it &apos;s a gentle soul that vorzieht the society of animals .
he wakes up about the giant waldgebiete that span far in the east .
and that &apos;s good , because the evil will always try to grab foot in this world .
not good .
not good at all .
yuck .
oh no , sebaste .
you love kindness .
there you go . my god , you can &apos;t breathe .
that way .
here .
here .
i don &apos;t realize why it doesn &apos;t work .
that &apos;s not after all hexerei .
hexerei .
oh , but yeah .
a dark and a powerful magic .
where on earth does these widerlichen creatures come from ?
the old festung ?
führ me .
this is where we beat our nachtlager .
fili , kili , takes the ponys .
and stay with them .
a farmer and his family lived here .
oin , gloin .
make a fire .
yes ?
right .
i think it would be smarter , weiterzuziehen .
we could go to the hidden valley .
i &apos;ve been told you .
we don &apos;t go near that place .
why not ?
the elben are helpful .
there we could eat , sleep , get advice .
i don &apos;t need any advice .
we have a map we can &apos;t read .
mr. elrond could help us .
help ?
a kite has attacked the erebor .
what help came from the elben ?
orks plünderten moria , schändeten our holy halls .
the elben watched just watch tatenlos .
and you verlangst that i just said the aufsuche that told my grandfather ?
that told my father .
you &apos;re not both of them .
i gave you a map , and i didn &apos;t move to the past so you were going to go .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;ve heard you .
all right ?
gandalf , where do you want to go ?
i &apos;m looking for the society of the one who is still in significant mind .
and who is that ?
i , mr. beutlin .
that was enough zwerge for a day .
well , bombur , we &apos;re hungry .
is he coming back ?
it &apos;s been quite a long time .
who ?
gandalf .
he &apos;s a magician .
he does what he wants .
here , i love the guy , and i take these guys .
now end .
you had enough .
the eintopf is not even bad .
ever ate worse .
yes , what dori is always cooking .
ha , ha , ha .
zum .
what &apos;s going on ?
we should take care of these ponys .
only we &apos;ve encountered a little problem .
we had 16 .
now it &apos;s 14 .
margerite and bungo are missing .
what ? so , that &apos;s not good .
ha , ha .
and that &apos;s not good at all .
shouldn &apos;t we say that ?
uh , no .
we didn &apos;t use it with it .
when our verbürgter meisterdieb , you could follow the thing .
so , uh ...
one big thing has herausgerissen these trees .
well , we thought .
something very big , and possibly dangerous .
hey .
there &apos;s a light .
there it is .
stay down .
what is there ?
trolle .
oh .
he has myrte and minzi .
they will eat them .
we need to have what companies do .
yeah , unternimm .
bergtrolle are slowly and stupid , and you &apos;re so small that never see you .
nothing happens .
we &apos;re right behind you .
if there &apos;s a lot of anger in trouble , 2-mal schuhu like a schleiereule , and once a schnee-eule .
2-mal like a schnee-eule and once a ...
is that really a good idea ?
yesterday , hammel , hammel , and verdamme me , if you don &apos;t have hammel the morning .
stop quaken .
these are not hammel .
these are fresh gäule .
oh !
i don &apos;t like horse .
i never liked .
it &apos;s not enough fat .
still better than zäher , age farmer .
it was just skin and bone .
i still have between the teeth .
oh , wonderful . this is actually swimming up .
it &apos;s getting würze .
ah .
where that comes from , there &apos;s more ' .
you can stay beautiful .
aua !
sit down !
i hope you take the gäule right .
the stinkigen parts i don &apos;t like .
aua !
i said , sit down .
i was hungry .
is there another horse , or what ?
schnauze .
your fresst , what i vorsetze you .
why is he actually the chef ?
all right .
everything tastes like chicken .
except chicken .
that tastes for fish !
i mean , just a little bit more gratitude .
oh . thank you , bert .
köstlicher eintopf , bert .
so is that so hard ?
psst .
psst , psst .
psst .
there &apos;s still eichhörnchen-würze .
hey , that &apos;s my cup .
excuse me .
aua !
oh , that &apos;s a complete abgeschmeckt , i would say .
fressluke . probier times .
delicious , what ?
that &apos;s why i am a chef .
oh , maybe i might be the stomach .
i have to do something else .
meat , i need meat .
ah !
ah !
rotz and reiher !
bert .
bert !
look at what &apos;s going on from the zinken .
it has arms and legs and everything .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
but it &apos;s disgusting , it &apos;s rumzappelt .
what are you ?
a übergroßes squirrel ?
i &apos;m a master ...
uh , hobbit .
a meisterhobbit ?
can you braten it ?
we can try and get ' .
there &apos;s just one happen .
there &apos;s no longer , no skin and bone .
maybe there &apos;s more meisterhobbits on that .
machen .
start it !
it &apos;s too fast .
come on , you guys ...
i have you .
have more of you hidden here .
where don &apos;t you have to go ?
no .
it &apos;s lying .
no , i don &apos;t do it .
now , hold his toes on fire .
i want him to plärrt !
let him down !
how was that ?
i said , let &apos;s go down .
get the sacks .
put them in the sacks .
ow !
fast , up up .
bilbo !
no !
cut out the weapons , we reißen it apart .
oh , again .
hot , hot , hot . hot !
we don &apos;t need to cook them .
we sit on them , and we zerdrücken them .
you should be sie and grillen , and a prise salbei streuen .
is that really necessary ?
it sounds really delicious .
i don &apos;t think so .
friss somebody , who &apos;s the size of you .
forget the spices .
we don &apos;t have time .
it will soon be a day . we cut .
because i don &apos;t intend to become stone .
wait !
you just make a horrible mistake .
you can &apos;t talk to them .
these are einfaltspinsel !
einfaltspinsel ?
and then what are we ?
i mean , what the spices is .
yes ? what about the gewürzen ?
did you smell about those ?
you &apos;ve got to have something like kräftigeres when you &apos;re going to get on the plate .
verräter ! what do you know from cooking zwergen ?
hold it up .
let the kleisterdings-meisterhobbit excuses go .
the secret to zwerge cooking is that ...
yes ?
tell us the secret .
the secret is , you just häuten .
so , um ...
yeah , i do .
are you crazy ?
tom , get my scharfes knife .
i get the skin off , you mieser verräter !
i don &apos;t forget that .
i don &apos;t forget that .
but this is all stupid geschwätz .
i &apos;ve been eating a lot of my skin .
i say we verdrücken them as they are .
he &apos;s right .
a happen roher dwarf can never hurt .
fresh and knackig .
oh , not there .
it &apos;s contaminated .
what ?
what is it ?
yes , he has worms in his gedärmen .
yuck !
ah !
verseucht are all together .
they &apos;re completely verwurmt , to obenhin .
widerliche matter .
i wouldn &apos;t risk that , honestly .
worms ?
did he say worms ?
we have no worms .
you have worms .
what &apos;s the blödsinn , little ?
i have worms as thick as my arm .
my worms are the most absolutely biggest .
i have huge worms .
yeah , i &apos;m a verwurmt .
i &apos;m also verwurmt .
yes , verseucht and through .
yeah , and what should we do now ?
let &apos;s all run again ?
well ...
do you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing ?
the little frettchen thinks that we are fools .
frettchen ?
fools ?
the day is supposed to meet you .
who is that ?
no idea .
can we eat that too ?
oh , take the foot from my cross .
ah .
where were you abgeblieben ?
take a look ahead .
what did you do ?
look at the back .
that was unerfreulich .
after all , all the colonies have remained .
you don &apos;t thank your meisterdieb .
he had enough grips to win time .
none of you came up with this .
they have to come from the ettenöden .
so , when a car is moving so far in the south ?
oh .
they didn &apos;t do that forever .
a dunklere power was in the back of this country .
you can &apos;t be outside at daylight .
that means there &apos;s a cave near that .
oh , what &apos;s this smell ?
it &apos;s a troll-hort .
watch what you &apos;re doing .
but if it &apos;s a bad thing to do here .
you could take it .
i see that way .
nori .
yes ?
get a schaufel .
this schwerter has no troll geschmiedet .
and just as little as human beings .
they were made in gondolin , from the hochelben of the first age .
you can &apos;t wish a blade .
quick , this is still true .
it &apos;s good .
and now bury .
so , we then pay out the numbers later .
nothing like out of this widerwärtigen hole .
come on . we should go .
bofur , gloin , nori .
bilbo .
yes ?
here .
it fits your size .
it &apos;s not .
elben geschmiedet this blade , which means it &apos;s blue blue , as soon as orks or bilwisse are near .
i &apos;ve never made a sword in life .
and i hope you &apos;ve never got to .
now , if you think about it .
true courage doesn &apos;t mean to be able to take life , but to preserve it .
there &apos;s something !
gandalf .
sit together !
eilt you !
guns you !
diebe !
fire !
mordio !
radagast .
this is radagast , the brown .
so ...
what , in all the world , are you here ?
i looked for you , gandalf .
something is wrong .
something is completely true .
yes ?
oh .
let me just pause .
oh .
i had a thought , and now i &apos;m entfallen .
it was there , it &apos;s been on my tongue .
oh .
it wasn &apos;t even thought .
it &apos;s just one ... stabschrecke .
the grünwald is sick , gandalf .
a dark has shrunk it .
nothing gedeiht more .
at least nothing good .
the air googled verwesung .
but the worst is nets .
nets ?
what do you mean with that ?
spiders , gandalf .
huge .
if that &apos;s not ungoliants , i don &apos;t want to be a magician .
i followed them .
they came from dol guldur .
what ?
dol guldur ?
the old festung is left .
no , gandalf .
it &apos;s not .
a dark power haust into her , as i &apos;ve never felt .
it &apos;s the shadow of an ancient grauens .
one who can herbeirufen the minds of the dead .
i saw it , gandalf .
the darkness is a nekromant entstiegen .
radagast .
watch up !
quick !
quick , quick !
wait me !
sorry .
take a train alter .
it helps to calm down nerves .
and out .
so , a nekromant .
are you sure ?
this is not from the world of living .
was that a wolf ?
are there wolves out there ?
wolves ?
no , that &apos;s not a wolf .
kili !
get your bow !
warg-späher .
then the ork-meute can &apos;t be tv .
ork-meute ?
who , except your sippe , did you tell from your purpose ?
nobody .
who knows ?
no one , i swear .
what , in durins names , is going on here ?
you &apos;re going to hunt to you .
we have to disappear here .
we can &apos;t .
we have no ponys .
they are qualified .
i &apos;m going to weglocken them .
these are gundabad-warge .
you &apos;ll catch up .
and these are rhosgobel-kaninchen .
they &apos;ll try it quietly .
come on .
come on .
come on and start me !
ha , ha !
come on . fast .
stay together .
further !
ori , no !
back .
everybody . come on .
where do you pay us ?
there !
run !
there they are !
here !
quick !
there &apos;s more !
erschießt .
we &apos;re surrounded !
where is gandalf ?
he &apos;ll let us down .
hold up !
here , you fools !
hurry you !
fast !
everybody down !
go ahead , go on .
go , go , go .
eight , nine , 10 , 10 .
kili !
run !
elben .
do we follow him or not ?
we naturally follow him .
that would be the klügste .
gandalf ?
where are we ?
do you spürst it ?
yeah .
it feels like ...
well , like magic .
and that &apos;s what it is .
a very powerful magic .
there &apos;s light on the front .
the valley of imladris .
it &apos;s known under another name .
bruchtal .
here &apos;s the last heimelige house east of the lake .
that &apos;s what you had from the beginning .
zuflucht in our enemies .
enemies are not there , thorin eichenschild .
the only groll that you find in this valley is the one you hegt .
do you think the elben of our imagination will be your blessing ?
you will want to stop it .
of course , they will .
but we have questions that we need to answer .
if we want to succeed , we have to deal with taktgefühl .
and respect .
and there &apos;s a big degree of charm .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to talk to me .
mithrandir .
ah .
lindir .
it &apos;s on the hat .
i have to talk to mr. elrond .
my lord elrond is not here .
not here ?
where is he ?
hold the rows !
gandalf .
mr. elrond .
so unusual for orks , to come close to our border .
something or somebody would probably kill you .
ah .
we could have been .
welcome , thorin , son of the thrain .
i don &apos;t think we know .
you have your grandfather &apos;s appearance .
i knew thror when he knew him .
king was under the mountains .
yeah ?
he never talked about you .
what did he say ?
was that about an insult ?
no , master gloin , just an invitation to eat .
well , if this is , it goes forward .
come on . come on .
try it .
a tiny tiny häppchen . just to .
no , green food i don &apos;t like .
where is the meat ?
or gebratene potatoes ?
thank you for having me .
if i &apos;m not dressed for dinner too .
you &apos;re never here .
not quite my taste , the elbenmädchen . it &apos;s thin .
the high wangenknochen , the seidene skin .
too little gesichtsbehaarung , i find .
however , it &apos;s not bad .
this is not a elbenmädchen .
very funny .
this is orkrist , the orkspalter .
a famous blade , geschmiedet from the west of the west , my sippe .
may you do good services .
and this is glamdring , the feindhammer .
sword of the king of gondolin .
these schwerter were made for the orkkriege in the first age .
don &apos;t mind .
schwerter are called großen , which they do in war .
does that mean , my sword has no battle yet ?
i don &apos;t even know if it &apos;s a sword .
it looks like a brieföffner .
how are they going to be in your property ?
we found them in a troll-hort , at the big oststraße . shortly after that , we found them .
überfielen uns .
and what do you do on the great scale ?
entschuldigt me .
13 zwerge and a halbling .
yeah .
strange reisegefährten , gandalf .
these are the offspring of the house .
noble , decent people .
and surprisingly kultiviert .
they &apos;re big verehrer .
art .
do you even do something else ?
i &apos;m going to get on a funeral .
did anybody die ?
all right boys , i think there &apos;s only one .
old krug krug .
old krug krug .
in the old steinkrug .
likewise , the hang bias .
and they put a beer in the moon as brown as the man in the moon .
look and lay out .
in the rausche period long .
oh oh .
the knecht knecht hat .
plays fiedel ganz .
his bow sägt the strings .
so , quietscht .
so , brummt .
in sight , no end .
the one of the world &apos;s brains .
hangover plays playing .
hei-didel-dum auf , when he called the dead results
he sägt and plays the sound quickly .
and the mondmann call :
it &apos;s going to be bright .
and the bell längst 3 .
our actions don &apos;t go to the elben .
the map is the legacy of my people , and it &apos;s to protect them . you mean my goodness , thorin .
just like your secrets .
marcus : i mean , somebody in front of the sturheit der .
your pride is still going to be your demise .
you &apos;re here before one of the few in mittelerde who can read this card .
show mr. elrond .
thorin , no .
erebor ?
what are you interested in this map ?
it &apos;s mostly gedankenspiele .
as you know , these pieces contain bisweilen hidden texts .
you can read the old zwergisch , right ?
mondrunen .
of course .
it &apos;s easy to overlook .
in this case , that &apos;s true .
you can read it just in the light of a moon that &apos;s equivalent to the stage and the season that you &apos;re written to .
do you mind reading her ?
these runen were written on the evening of a zunehmenden , a growing moon , about 200 years ago .
apparently , it &apos;s been determined to come to bruchtal .
the fate is gewogen .
thorin eichenschild , because the same moon seems tonight .
imagine the gray rock when the drossel hits , and the untergehende sun am its final beam on the durinstag .
hinabfallen is on the schlüsselloch .
durinstag ?
the first day of the new year of zwerge , when the last herbstmond and the first wintersonne are in the sky .
bad news .
the summer goes on .
the durinstag will soon be there .
we still have time .
time ?
what ?
finding the entrance .
we need to be right in the right place , right at the right time .
and then only then , the door can be opened .
so that &apos;s your intention . you want to go into the mountain .
and if it was ?
some of one would not be a weise .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s anschickt over mittelerde .
i don &apos;t want to hear excuses .
uh -- i &apos;m certainly not going to miss .
in fact , most people , i should not be on this journey .
in fact ?
i heard hobbits are very resilient .
really ?
mhm .
and i heard they schätzten the comfort of their heims .
i heard it &apos;s unklug to look for the advice of the elben , because they always respond with yes and no .
you &apos;re very welcome when you wish it , hierzubleiben .
but you did exactly the same thing .
don &apos;t do so innocent .
dori !
here , take this .
bombur !
of course , i wanted to tell you .
right at this opportunity .
you can &apos;t trust that i know what i do .
this kite has slept for 60 years .
what if your plan misslingt ?
if you shake the bestie ?
and if we do it ?
when the zwerge zurückerobern the mountain , our defense is empowered in the east .
it &apos;s a dangerous step , gandalf .
it &apos;s also dangerous to do nothing .
the thron of erebor is thorins legacy .
what do you fear ?
have you forgotten it ?
there &apos;s a bias to madness in this family .
his grandfather lost the mind .
his father is the same disease .
can you recall that thorin eichenschild doesn &apos;t anheimfällt you too ?
gandalf , these decisions are not alone with us .
it &apos;s not you nor me to draw the map of mittelerde .
or without our help , these zwerge are going to march to the mountain .
they &apos;re determined to zurückzufordern their home .
i don &apos;t think thorin eichenschild of opinion is to be guilty .
that &apos;s not me .
not to give me responsibility .
woman galadriel .
mithrandir .
i didn &apos;t know that mr. elrond sent to you .
he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s me .
ah .
saruman .
you &apos;re quite umtriebig , my friend .
tell me , gandalf , did you think you were serious , you &apos;d stay in the schilde ?
notice ?
no .
i just do what i mean for right .
the dragon &apos;s going on for you .
that &apos;s true , herrin .
smaug is no treue .
but if he verbünden with the enemy , this kite would have an incredibly devastating effect .
what enemy ?
gandalf , the enemy is defeated .
sauron became bezwungen .
he will never return his full strength .
don &apos;t you mind that the last of the zwergenringe just disappears ? together with the guy wearing it ?
from the seven zwergenringen , four of the dragons were destroyed . two had sauron , before he unterging in mordor .
the geschick of the last zwergenringes remains unknown .
the ring , the thrain .
without the ruling ring of power , the seven rings are no value for the enemy .
to beherrschen the rest of the rings , he needs one .
this ring was lost a long , long time ago .
it was hinausgespült into the sea . it was the floods of the anduin .
gandalf , for 400 years , we &apos;ve been living in peace now , and we &apos;ve been living in peace and schützenswerten peace .
do we have that ?
do we have peace ?
trolle are moving from mountains into the valleys .
they steal villages , destroying höfe .
orks were attacking us on the street .
hardly a cause to war .
they always have to involve you , and look for problems where none are .
let &apos;s talk it .
here &apos;s something that is a lot more bösartiger than smaug .
something far more mächtigeres .
we can wegsehen , but i promise you , it &apos;s not going to release us .
the grünwald is sick .
the waldmenschen there call him düsterwald .
and they say ...
yes ?
go on .
tell us what the waldmenschen are saying .
they talk about a nekromanten in dol guldur .
a hexer that can leave the dead wiederauferstehen .
that &apos;s absurd .
there &apos;s no such power in this world .
this nekromant is nothing more than a sterblicher person .
it &apos;s a scharlatan that tries to be in black magic .
and that &apos;s what i was .
but radagast saw ...
radagast ?
don &apos;t tell me about radagast , the brown .
he &apos;s a einfältiger narr .
well , he &apos;s strange , i &apos;ll admit .
he &apos;s leading a einsames life .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s actually due to its maßlosen of mushrooms .
through it , his brain has become soft and his teeth are yellow .
i warned him .
it &apos;s not ziemt to be wrong in such a state in the state of forests .
your tragt is something .
you &apos;ve got it from radagast .
he found it in dol guldur .
yeah .
show me .
listen .
you could have thought , i did selbstgespräche , unaufmerksam , as he was .
of course , it &apos;s important to understand the wisdom of all beings , but ...
what is that ?
a relic of mordor .
a morgulklinge .
geschmiedet for hexenkönig hexenkönig .
and he was buried with him .
as a angmar unterging , people took their body , and everything he owned , and they locked it into the felshöhen of rhudaur .
deep in the stone , they put it in a gruft , so dark that no light ever reaches it .
that &apos;s not possible .
a powerful magic is on these grüften .
they can &apos;t be opened .
what &apos;s evidence for that that this gun comes from the hexenkönigs grave ?
i don &apos;t have one .
there is no one .
let &apos;s go to what we know .
a single horde orks orks over the bruinen .
a sword of one last age was found .
and a human hexenmeister , which is called the nekromant , has a festungsruine häuslich .
that &apos;s essentially not a lot .
but the purpose of this zwergischen unternehmung worries me deeply .
i &apos;m not convinced , gandalf .
i can &apos;t be gutheißen this way .
if they had come to me , i would have saved those disappointment .
i don &apos;t understand your reasons why you &apos;ve made hope , gandalf .
they break up .
yeah .
you did .
no . there &apos;s no more to say .
my lord elrond .
the zwerge , they continue .
get all the good eight .
right now , we cross the border to the wilderness .
balin , you know these pathways , go ahead .
yeah .
champion beutlin , it &apos;s time to sputen .
you will follow them .
yeah .
you &apos;re right to help thorin eichenschild .
but i &apos;m afraid that this business has forces that we don &apos;t understand yet .
the mystery about the morgul-klinge needs to be solved .
something moves in darkness . ungesehen , hidden in front of our view .
it won &apos;t show up .
not yet .
but every day it gains strength .
be on the hat .
mithrandir ?
why the halbling ?
i don &apos;t know .
saruman is the idea that only big power can fall evil .
but i learned different .
i think these are the little things , everyday , of ordinary people that keep the darkness away .
simple did kindness and love .
why bilbo beutlin ?
maybe because i fear , and he gives me courage .
don &apos;t fear you , mithrandir .
you &apos;re not alone .
careful !
slowly .
ah !
bilbo !
we need to find a shelter !
caution !
brother , watch up !
deckung !
this is not a donnergrollen .
this is a donnerschlacht !
see !
gütiger skies .
the legends are true .
giant !
steinriesen !
get out , narr !
hold !
what &apos;s going on here ?
take my hand !
run , go , go !
fast , run .
way , gone here !
fast !
warning !
warning !
spring !
do it !
hang on !
no !
no !
no !
kili !
nothing happens !
they &apos;re alive !
where is bilbo ?
where is the hobbit ?
there !
help him !
ah !
hang on !
bilbo !
ori , be careful !
greif my hand !
i have you , boy .
just turn up !
push !
go .
up with him .
come on , boy .
up with you .
we almost had lost our meisterdieb .
he &apos;s lost since we &apos;re open .
he should never have come back .
he &apos;s not listening to us .
dwalin !
it seems safe .
look at the back .
antarctica in mountains are rarely uninhabited .
here &apos;s nothing .
all right , let &apos;s just make a nice fire .
no .
no fire .
not here .
schlaft a little .
at tagesanbruch we go on .
we should be waiting in the mountains until gandalf to come in .
that was the plan .
plans change .
bofur , übernimm the first board .
so where do you want to go ?
back to bruchtal .
no , you can &apos;t reverse now .

where is our hobbit ?
verfluchter halbling .
it &apos;s gone now .
i thought he &apos;d be at dori !
don &apos;t put it on me .
where did you see it last ?
i think when they caught us , he could davonstehlen .
what &apos;s happening ?
talk !
i tell you what happened .
champion beutlin has recognized the opportunity and it was moving .
since he got out of his door , he was just thinking of his weiches bed and his warm oven .
we &apos;re not going to go back to our hobbit .
it &apos;s continued , it &apos;s long .
he &apos;s not .
bilbo beutlin .
in my entire life , i &apos;ve never been so happy to see someone .
bilbo .
we had given you up .
how do you go to the orks ?
good question .
what does it matter to ?
he &apos;s back here .
it plays a role .
i want to know .
why are you back here ?
i know you &apos;re going to go back to me , and that &apos;s the beginning .
and you &apos;re right .
i often think of beutelsend .
i vermiss my books .
and my chair . my garden .
there i am .
this is home .
and that &apos;s why i came back .
a home .
it was taken to you .
but i want to help you bring back .
out of the pan .
in the fire .
run .
run !
up to the trees !
everybody ! immediately !
go , climbs !
bilbo , klettere up .

thorin !
thorin .
the halbling ?
don &apos;t worry .
bilbo is here .
it &apos;s wohlauf .
you !
what did you do ?
that could have cost you .
didn &apos;t i say , you were a load ?
you don &apos;t überlebst in the wild ?
that you will never belong to us ?
i &apos;ve never deceive myself . all my life .
verzeih my doubt on you .
no . i &apos;d just gezweifelt myself .
i &apos;m not a hero . and not a warrior .
not even a meisterdieb .
is that what i think ?
our home .
a rabe !
the birds go back to the mountain .
that , my rather oin , is a drossel .
but we see it as a sign .
as a good omen .
right .
the worst thing is , i would say .
[ german german german
i verdurste over here !
come on .
come on .
thank you .
thank you .
caution !
sorry , love .
you know , get ' .
thank you .
champion stadel .
can i dazugesellen ?
the same thing for me .
i should imagine .
my name is gandalf .
gandalf of gray .
i know who you are .
well , that &apos;s a enjoyable coincidence .
what leads thorin eichenschild to bree ?
i &apos;ve learned that my father had been seen in the wild at dunland .
i looked for him , but couldn &apos;t find him .
thorin , you haven &apos;t heard anything about thrain for a long time .
he &apos;s still alive .
i &apos;m sure .
before my dad disappeared , he aufgesucht you .
what did you say to him ?
i was drängte him to march the erebor , to versammeln the 7 of the zwerge , to kill the dragon and bring back the lone mountain .
and i would say the same thing .
get your home back .
this encounter is not an accident , or , gandalf ?
no .
it &apos;s not .
the lonely mountain worries me , thorin .
this kite has been long enough .
or sooner or later , dunklere intentions are erebor .
on the grünweg , i came up with a couple of ungehobelte design .
they thought i was a vagabunden .
what you probably have regrets .
one of them had a message to themselves .
this is black language .
a reward is promised .
what ?
your head .
someone wants your death .
thorin , you no longer wait for dürft .
you &apos;re the legacy of durins thron .
united states is united .
together , you have the power , the erebor zurückzuerobern .
aurora is a gathering of 7 zwergenvölker .
it requires you to stand up to your eid .
the seven heere have the eid of the geschworen who &apos;s wearing the königsjuwel .
the arkenstein .
and if you &apos;ve forgotten , this edelstein was stolen , from smaug .
what if i help you , zurückzubekommen ?
how ?
the arkenstein is far away from here , buried under a fire speienden .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
and that &apos;s why we need a meisterdieb .
how close is the meute ?
too close .
some wegstunden , more not .
but it &apos;s even worse .
do we have gewittert ?
not yet .
but you will .
we have a problem .
did you see ?
you &apos;ve been seeing .
no , it &apos;s not .
what did i tell you ?
mucksmäuschenstill .
it &apos;s appropriate .
would you please listen ?
i &apos;m trying to tell you that there &apos;s something else up there .
what shape ?
one bear ?
yeah ...
yes , but bigger .
much bigger .
you knew about this bestie ?
i say we &apos;ve come .
to get caught from orks caught ?
there &apos;s a house , it &apos;s not far from here , and there we could go zuflucht .
whose house ?
my freund ?
neither nor .
it will help us or kill us .
have we a choice ?
no .
run !
along here .
fast !
run !
bombur , come on !
home !
run !
go in there .
open the door !
fast !
squeeze !
squeeze !
dwalin !
come on , guys !
what is that ?
that &apos;s our host .
his name is beorn .
and he &apos;s a hautwechsler .
sometimes he &apos;s a giant black bear , sometimes a great strong person .
the bear is unpredictable , but people are beizukommen with reason .
but he doesn &apos;t value zwerge .
it disappears .
come away from the door .
that &apos;s not natural .
none of it .
it &apos;s obvious .
a dark curse is on him .
not töricht .
the magic is part of him .
well , let &apos;s all sleep .
here you are safe tonight .
i hope anyway .
so you &apos;re the one they call eichenschild .
tell me , why does azog azog hunt to you ?
you know from azog ?
where ?
my people was the first to live in the mountains before the orks came out of the north .
the schänder has almost killed my entire family .
but some people thought he was a slave .
not to work , to the pastime .
hautwechsler einzusperren and to torture , seemed to be belustigen .
is there more like you ?
once there were many .
and now ?
now there &apos;s one more thing .
you have to reach the mountain before the last herbsttagen .
it &apos;s marriage of the durinstag .
yeah .
you don &apos;t have a lot of time .
that &apos;s why we have to go through the düsterwald .
a dark lies over this forest .
cruel beings crawl around the brush .
the orks of moria and the nekromant in dol guldur have verbündet .
just in the number of not i would be there .
we &apos;re going to take the elbenweg .
it &apos;s certainly safe .
sure ?
the waldelben of the düsterwalds are different .
they &apos;re less smart , they &apos;re dangerous .
but what does it do .
how do you mean that ?
in this area , it &apos;s about orks .
it &apos;s increasing more .
and you &apos;re on foot .
you &apos;ve never reached this forest alive .
i don &apos;t like zwerge .
they &apos;re greedy and blind .
blind to the lives of those who are holding them for less than themselves .
but i hate more .
what do you need ?
right now .
as long as it &apos;s bright .
they &apos;re going to hunt , no longer .
the elbentor .
here &apos;s our path through the düsterwald .
not to see orks .
happiness is on our side .
let the ponys now go free .
you should return to your gentleman .
this forest seems to be kind of sick .
it &apos;s like befallen from one suffering .
is there really no way around ?
only if we go to the south of 200 miles or five miles to south .
something moves in darkness . ungesehen , hidden in front of our view .
every day it gains strength .
hütet you before the nekromanten .
he &apos;s not what he seems to be .
if our enemy is back , we need to know .
go to the grüften in the mountains .
the felshöhen .
it &apos;s like that .
my horse doesn &apos;t !
i need it !
do you want to leave us ?
i wouldn &apos;t have to do it if i didn &apos;t have to .
you changed you , bilbo beutlin .
you &apos;re no longer the guy who has left the auenland .
i wanted to tell you something .
i found something in the orkstollen .
what ?
what did you find ?
my courage .
good .
well , that &apos;s good .
you will need them .
i expect you at the aussichtsposten edge of the erebor .
verwahrt the map and the key .
not without me in the mountain .
this forest is not the grünwald of ehedem .
even the air in the forest is full of sinnestäuschungen .
he &apos;s going to try to make your mind be wrong .
we have our minds irre ?
what does that mean ?
you have to stay on the path .
doesn &apos;t come from him .
if you do it , you &apos;ll never find it .
whatever happens , it stays on the way .
come on .
we have to reach the erebor before the sun ends up on the durinstag .
durinstag ?
then go .
we can only find the secret door in the mountain .
this is where the path continues .
along here .
i don &apos;t get air .
my head swimming everything .
what &apos;s going on ?
go on .
nori , why are you staying standing ?
the path , it &apos;s gone .
what &apos;s going on here ?
we lost the way !
get it .
all right , everybody , addiction .
look the way .
and that &apos;s not what i remember .
nothing familiar with me .
he has to be here .
what did we have ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t even know which day we have .
does this verfluchte forest take no end ?
atterkopp .
see .
a tabaksbeutel .
there are zwerge in this forest .
zwerge from the blue mountains .
it looks like mine .
it &apos;s yours too .
do you understand ?
we walk around .
we lost ourselves .
we don &apos;t .
we go to the east .
and where is east ?
we lost the sun .
i thought you &apos;re masters in the field .
the sun .
we have to find them , the sun .
up there .
we need to go beyond the baumwipfel .
what is that ?
now that &apos;s enough .
be silent ! everybody !
we &apos;re observed .
i see a lake !
and a river .
and the lone mountain .
we &apos;re almost there !
do you hear me ?
i know where we need to go .
hello ?
hello .
oh no .
oh , not yet .
kill them !
kill them .
eat the same as long as your blood flows .
your fur is zäh , but inside you &apos;re beautiful .
do it again .
do it again .
kill it .
the meat is quicklebendig !
kill him .
now kill him .
let &apos;s eat .
eat !

eat alive !

what is there ?
what is there ?

fat and saftig .
just a little häppchen .
cursed !
where is it ?
where is it ?

ah !
it sticht !
sticht !
clean .
a good name .
clean .
all right , bofur ?
i don &apos;t have anything .
away , pull it away !
where is bilbo ?
i &apos;m up here !
take the legs !
pull !
pull !
oh , where is he ?
where is he ?
come .
where is he ?
no !
no !
no !
go ahead , quick now !
hurry you !
come on !
watch up , brother !
fili !
mine .
come on , quick now !
they &apos;re gone .
don &apos;t think i would kill you , zwerg .
it would be a pleasure .
help !
kili !
werft me over .
fast !
if you think i &apos;m going to give you a gun , it &apos;s zwerg you .
checking them .
hey !
give it to this !
that &apos;s personal .
who is that ?
your brother ?
and the other , gräuliche creature ?
a ork-wechselbalg .
this is my little boy . gimli .
how did you do that ?
it was given to me .
not just a dieb , but also a liar .
thorin , where is bilbo ?
that &apos;s going to be leidtun .
you heard ?
let &apos;s get out here !
don &apos;t grab me !
don &apos;t you want to go through me ?
i could have anything in the silence .
or nothing .
let &apos;s do that !
we &apos;re not coming out here !
this is not a orkverlies .
these are the halls of the waldland-reiches .
nobody &apos;s coming out here without the einwilligung of the king .
your journey may have a hehren objective .
you want to kill your home and kill a dragon .
i even suspect behind your action , rather noble motives .
you perform an theft or something like that .
you found a way into it .
you &apos;re looking at what gives you the right to rule .
the königsjuwel .
the arkenstein .
it &apos;s valuable for you all orders .
i understand that .
and in this mountain , there are edelsteine , which i begehre .
white stones from pure light .
i offer you my help .
i &apos;m completely ear .
i &apos;m going to leave you when you give me what my is .
a favor for you .
i &apos;ll give you my word .
from one king to another .
i don &apos;t think thranduil , the great king , is holding his word , even though the end of all the days .
you don &apos;t have any honor .
i saw how you treat your friends .
once we came to you , hungernd , heimatlos , and asked for your help .
but you get away .
you don &apos;t have any share of my people &apos;s suffering , and the inferno that vernichtet us .
don &apos;t tell me about the drachenfeuer .
i know how angry and deadly it is .
i &apos;ve been struggling against the great feuerschlangen of the nordens .
i warned your grandfather what to do .
he didn &apos;t want to hear .
you &apos;re just like him .
if you want , and you &apos;re going to be verfault .
100 years are just a wimpernschlag in the lives of a elben .
i have patience .
i can wait .
did he invent a trade ?
yeah .
i told him îsh kakhfê ai -- ' d dûr-rugnu !
he &apos;s on his und .
well , that &apos;s what you might do .
a trade was our only hope .
not our only hope .
i know you &apos;re here .
tell , why are you in the shadows ?
i wanted to report you .
did i have no befohlen to destroy this nest , less than two moons ?
we have the forest like befohlen gesäubert , my king .
they &apos;re breeding in the ruins of dol guldur .
we could kill them there .
this festung is beyond our limits .
keep these creatures away from our realm .
that &apos;s your job .
and if we built them up ? what ?
don &apos;t you move to other people ?
other states are not mine .
the fortunes of the world bring rise and doom .
but here , in this kingdom , we will outlive .
legolas said you fought well today .
he &apos;s very zugetan .
i assure you , my king , legolas doesn &apos;t look at me as the anführerin of the police station .
that might have been like this .
now i &apos;m not so sure anymore .
i don &apos;t think your son would allow your son to promise a simple waldelbe .
no , sure , i wouldn &apos;t .
and yet , he likes to .
don &apos;t make him hope where no .
the stone in your hand , what is that ?
a glücksbringer .
a powerful magic is on that .
reads another one as a dwarf that runen , it &apos;s always cursed .
or not .
and if you think about that .
just a memory .
a runenstein .
my mother gave him to me so i think of my promise .
which promise ?
that i return to her .
she cares .
she &apos;s holding me for waghalsig .
are you ?
no .
there &apos;s a big party up there , right up there .
it &apos;s mereth e-ngilith , the sternenlicht-fest .
the eldar is all sacred .
but most people love the light of the stars .
i always thought it &apos;s a cold light .
unnahbar and far away .
it &apos;s memory , especially precious and pure .
like your promise .
i &apos;ve been there sometimes .
beyond the forest and up to the night .
i &apos;ve seen the world disappear , and the white light of the eternity is erfüllt .
i &apos;ve seen a feuermond .
he went on the passport at dunland .
huge .
red and golden , the whole sky leuchtete .
we eskortierten a group of kaufleute from the ered luin .
they traded silberarbeiten against felle .
we took the grünweg to south , the mountains on our left .
and then he appeared .
this huge feuermond and erleuchtete our way .
i wish i could show you the caves under these mountains .
galion , age gauner , we have nothing to drink .
the empty drums should have sent back to esgaroth .
the kahnführer is certainly waiting .
that &apos;s what you have to do with our übellaunigen king : it understands what it is .
come on , elros , probier .
i have to guard the zwerge .
they &apos;re locked up .
where should you go ?
ha , ha .
i bet the sun is going on .
the day is certainly broken .
we will never reach the mountain , right ?
as long as you &apos;re sitting in here , certainly not .
bilbo !
what ?
pscht !
here they are all wachen !
ha , ha , ha .
hold the doors .
that &apos;s how we win time .
all right , nori .
the staircase up .
you first .
ori .
not that long .
here .
follow me .
power .
caution .
over here .
come on .
you don &apos;t have ' .
we &apos;re in the basement !
you should be rausführen and not even deeper .
i know what i do .
pscht !
here !
here !
go , everyone in the drums , quick .
are you crazy ?
then you find us .
no , no .
don &apos;t you , i promise it .
please , please , you need to trust me .
he does what he says .
dwalin occupy your dicken karottenkopf there .
do it , bifur . get into the barrel .
go in with you , go , go , go .
everyone in it .
and what do we do now ?
get deep air .
get deep air ?
why ?
where is the police station with the schlüsseln ?
well done , master beutlin .
further !
now !
hold !
bilbo !
hang on !
help !
ori !
no !
watch up !
there they are !
under the bridge !
kili !
kili !
kili .
kili !
nori !
schlagt the baumstamm .
bombur !
tauriel .
oh , you !
why am i here , gandalf ?
believe me , radagast .
i didn &apos;t have called you triftigen .
for a gathering , no nice place .
no , it &apos;s not .
these are dark zaubersprüche , gandalf .
old and full of hate .
who is buried here ?
if he had a name , he &apos;s forgotten .
he &apos;s just known as a servant of evil .
one flock .
one from nine .
why now , gandalf ?
i don &apos;t realize that .
the ringgeister were called after dol guldur .
the nekromant can &apos;t be it .
a human hexenmeister could not beschwören such a freak .
who says something from human ?
the nine obey only one guy .
we were blind , radagast .
and in our blindness , the enemy comes back .
he calls his servant . why ?
azog der is not just a predator .
he &apos;s a leader .
he befehligt legionen .
the enemy is heading to war .
it &apos;s going to start in the east .
he &apos;s got it on this mountain .
where do you want to go ?
back to the other .
gandalf .
i started it .
i don &apos;t let them down .
they &apos;re in the biggest danger .
if it &apos;s true what you say , the whole world is in the biggest danger .
the power in that festung will be more powerful .
you verlangst that i zurücklasse my friends ?
is anything behind us ?
i see , not .
we have the orks abgehängt .
not for long , no current .
bombur is half ertrunken .
all for the bank !
all right .
come on .
gloin , help me , brother .
come on , up with you .
go !
come on , you riesenklotz !
i &apos;m okay , it &apos;s nothing .
stand up .
kili is verwundet .
his leg has to be connected .
a orkmeute follows us .
we need to continue .
and where ?
the mountain .
we are dense .
a lake is between us and the mountain .
we have nothing to cross it .
let &apos;s go around .
then we get the orks to track . todsicher .
we have no guns to defend us .
connect his leg , fast .
you have two minutes .
do that again , and you &apos;re dead .
sorry , but you &apos;re probably out of the seestadt when i &apos;m not mad .
that kahn that you have there wouldn &apos;t be any time to rent ?
how do you think i would help you ?
your boots have seen better days .
it &apos;s like your coat .
and no doubt you have to stopfen stopfen stopfen .
how many bälger ?
a boy and two girls .
and your wife , i think , is a beauty .
yeah .
that was her .
verzeiht .
it wasn &apos;t my intention .
oh , come on , stop .
end with the höflichkeiten .
why so a hurry ?
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;d like to know who you are . and what verschlägt you in this area .
we &apos;re very simple from the blue mountains , traveling to our relatives in the eisenbergen .
simple kaufleute , do you say ?
we need food , supplies , weapons .
can you help us ?
i know where these drums come from .
and if .
i don &apos;t know what you did with the elben . well , it &apos;s not ausgegangen .
you need the permission of the bürgermeisters to get into the seestadt .
its whole wealth comes from trade to the waldland-reich .
he put you in a chain rather than that he weckt the anger .
offer it more .
i bet in the city , you kind of get ungesehen .
yeah .
but for that , she bräuchtet a schmuggler .
and we pay twice that .
that &apos;s the nature of evil .
out there , in allgegenwärtiger ignorance , schwärt it and spreads .
a shadow growing in the dark .
a schlaflose bosheit , as black as the aufziehende of the night .
that &apos;s how it happened .
it will always be .
over time , all the fäulnis comes from .
you &apos;ve followed a community of 13 zwergen .
why ?
no 13th .
no longer .
the boy , the schwarzhaarige bogenschütze , our morgulpfeil getroffen .
the toxin is in his blood .
and soon he erstickt .
answer the question , scheusal .
i would rather be verärgern .
you like , ork ?
you like death ?
then i want to give it to you .
a dead dwarf is indifferent to me .
answer the question .
you have nothing to worry .
tell us what you know , and i &apos;m going to release you .
she did the command to kill her .
why ?
what &apos;s going on to you ?
this mickrige dwarf will never be king .
king ?
there &apos;s no king under the mountains , and there will never be one .
nobody cares to go to the erebor , as long as the dragon lives .
you don &apos;t know .
your world will burn .
what are you talking about ?
talk !
our time begins to new .
my gebieter serves one .
do you begreifst ?
the death is before .
the flames of the war are before .
why did you do that ?
you promised him to free him .
i did .
i &apos;ve liberated his fictional shoulders from his erbärmlichen skull .
this ork could have told us more .
i couldn &apos;t have said to him anymore .
what did he mean with flames of the war ?
it means you &apos;re going to release a power that &apos;s so powerful that it &apos;s all in your way .
the guards doubled our limitations !
all the rivers , all the rivers .
nothing happens without knowing that i know it .
nobody gets into that kingdom .
and nobody leaves it .
caution !
i was born at this wassern , and i was aufgewachsen .
i wanted to ertränken you , i wouldn &apos;t do it here .
oh , this vorlaute seemensch .
i say we throw it over , then calm .
oh , bard . the man is called bard .
how do you know ?
ah , i asked him .
i don &apos;t care how it is .
i can &apos;t suffer .
we don &apos;t have to suffer it .
we just have to pay it .
come on , guys .
krempelt your bags .
how do we know that he doesn &apos;t hintergeht us ?
not .
we &apos;re missing 10 coins .
gloin .
come on .
give us what you have .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
this journey has completely ausbluten me .
and what did i get for my aufwendung ?
nothing as grief and misery and ... ...
in my barte .
take it .
grab everything .
um .
money , quick .
we &apos;ll only pay you if we have our supplies .
if the freedom is dear to you , you do what i say .
there we go .
what does he do ?
he &apos;s talking to someone .
now he &apos;s looking at us directly .
now you &apos;ll give yourself your hand .
what ?
verräter .
he wants to deliver us .
quiet now .
we come to the zolltor .
stop !
warenkontrolle !
papers , please .
oh , you &apos;re , bard .
tomorrow , peredur .
have you a sign ?
nothing , i &apos;m just durchgefroren and tired and wants to go home .
it &apos;s like me .
please .
all right .
not so voreilig .
lieferung of empty fässern from the waldland-reich .
they &apos;re not empty , is it ' , bard ?
if i &apos;m quite entsinne , you &apos;ve been approved as a kahnführer .
and not as fishermen .
you can &apos;t do that .
error .
and the mayor goes to something , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
oh , come on , alfrid , have a heart .
people have to eat .
this fish is not authorized .
kippt the drums .
above .
you &apos;ve heard ' .
in the channel with it .
power .
hurry you .
the people of the city are suffering .
the times is heavy .
food is scarce .
that &apos;s not my problem .
stop .
always fürstreiter people , what , bard ?
the beschützer of the little people .
you still have your support , kahnführer , but not a long time .
opens the door !
the mayor has an eye on you .
you &apos;d rather notice that .
we know where you live .
it &apos;s a small city , alfrid .
everybody knows where he lives .
the whole talk of inner riots .
somebody schürt the fire , bless .
do you make the gicht , sir ?
that &apos;s the moisture , what else ?
get a branntwein .
people &apos;s mood , lord , gets aufsässig .
the secret people , alfrid , was always aufsässig .
what can i do for you to live in a place that insulted tran and tar ?
work , house , food .
same day the same . blöken and meckern .
i think you &apos;re going to be by unruhestiftern aufgewiegelt , sir .
mayor : then we have to find the unruhestifter and einsperren .
i also see that , gentleman .
and this talk of change has to be unterbunden .
i can &apos;t afford to have the pöbel zusammentut and aufmuckt .
the next thing they &apos;re going to do is they start asking , gather together , gathering research .
continuing with the old one , with the new one .
what ?
that &apos;s what everybody says , ok .
some munkeln even from elections .
election ?
that &apos;s absurd .
as if i would allow that .
i think that after that , no one would ask .
drückeberger .
undankbares pack .
volksverhetzer .
who would be so dreist , anzuzweifeln my authority ?
who would car ?
who ...
bard .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure .
this unruhestifter is a kahnführer .
take your hands away .
you didn &apos;t see them .
they were never here .
you can have fish for free .
follow me .
dad !
our house , it &apos;s observed .
tell the mayor that i &apos;m done today .
dad !
where were you ?
dad !
there you are !
i was so worried .
here , sigrid .
bain , get in .
if you tell anyone , i &apos;ll get both arms .
finger away .
up .
dad , why are they coming from our klosett ?
will they get us lucky ?
you may not quite fit , but you keep warm .
thank you . thank you .
a zwergen-windlanze .
have you seen a mind ?
that &apos;s what he has .
the last time we saw a weapon was a city in flames .
it was the day where the dragon was coming .
the day it destroyed thal thal .
girion , the fürst of thal , let his bogenschützen shoot on the bestie .
but a drachenhaut is thick .
bigger than the strongest armor .
just a black arrow , shot off a windlanze , can penetrate the skin of the dragon .
and very few of those arrows have ever been the fake .
and the supply of the supply was the last trial .
if he didn &apos;t end his goal , a lot would have come .
sounds like it &apos;s been wärt .
all the zwerge know the story .
then she wüsstet that girion had hit the dragon .
he solved a schuppe under the left wing .
another arrow , and he would have killed the bestie .
this is a kindermärchen , little .
nothing on .
you took our money .
where are the weapons ?
wait here .
tomorrow the last herbsttage start .
and the durinstag is already übermorgen .
we have to reach the mountain before .
and if we can &apos;t do it ?
what if we haven &apos;t found the secret door until then ?
then the whole path was free .
what should that be ?
a spießhaken .
made from an old harpune .
here ?
a krähenschnabel , we call it this .
from a schmiedehammer .
it &apos;s hard to be in hand , granted , but to defense of life , it &apos;s really better than nothing .
we paid you for guns .
from iron geschmiedete swords and äxte !
this is a joke !
you can &apos;t find anything better outside of the city .
all the geschmiedeten weapons are verschluss there .
thorin , let &apos;s take what &apos;s there and go .
i &apos;m already with less ausgekommen , and you do .
i say we break up .
you go nowhere .
what did you say ?
spione watch the house , and probably every steg and anleger in the city .
you have to wait until it gets dark .
thorin .
dad ?
don &apos;t go away .
tauriel , you can &apos;t hunt 30 orks alone .
i &apos;m not alone .
you know , i would come .
the king is indignant , tauriel .
for 600 years , my father will be protecting you .
and you don &apos;t befolgst your commands .
missachtest are trust .
the king has never approved that orks are going through our country .
but now he lets them kill the border and our prisoners .
that &apos;s not our fight .
it &apos;s our fight .
this is not going to end .
with each victory , evil becomes stronger .
when it comes to your dad , we don &apos;t do anything .
we hide behind walls , and a life goes away from the light , and we leave the darkness .
are we not part of the world ?
tell me , 18,000 .
when did we think that evil is becoming stronger than us ?
well , bard .
what do you seek ?
here was a wandteppich !
an age !
where is he ?
what wandteppich do you mean ?
this one .
these were zwerge , i tell you .
they came out of nowhere .
wirre bärte , wild eyes .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve never seen .
what have zwerge to look for in our area ?
that &apos;s the prophecy .
encouraging ?
the forecast of durins people .
the prophecy .
prophecy .
the old stories are true .
massive halls of estimation .
can that be true ?
is the lord of the silberquellen come back ?
the lord of the silberquellen
the king edlen steins
the king under the mountains .
take a look , what is his !
so , happy .
if the king of the king
wiederkehr wiederkehr wiederkehr
but all of this goes .
and the lake is going to be a flammenmeer .
dad , i tried to stop them !
how long are they going to continue ?
see what ?
not that loud .
once we have the weapons , we &apos;re going to break up to the mountain .
go ahead , go ahead .
go , nori .
next .
will it go ?
i can do that .
let &apos;s go fast .
run !
quick now !
finger away !
bring it over here .
make them legs !
what is this aufruhr ?
we caught them when they wanted to steal weapons , lord .
so hochverräter , huh ?
just a kümmerlicher pile when you ask me , lord .
hold your tongue !
you don &apos;t know who to do it with .
that &apos;s not any halunke .
this is thorin , son of thrain , son of thror !
we are the zwerge erebors .
and we &apos;ve come to our home .
i remember this town in the old times .
all of handelsflotten were in harbor , filled with silk and edelsteinen .
this was not a vergessene city on a lake .
this was the center of jedweden trade in the north .
i get this time back .
we entzünden the great background of the zwerge , that prosperity and prosperity wiederergießen , from the halls .
death !
that will bring you to us .
drachenfeuer and verderben !
if you hold your bestie , you will all vernichten us .
you can hear on these schwarzmaler , but i promise you .
if you can do it , all of you will get involved in the reichtum of the mountain .
then you have enough gold to build esgaroth 10 times .
you all !
listen to me !
you have to listen .
have you forgotten what happened to thal ?
have you forgotten your life in the feuersturm ?
and what do all this mean ?
for a bergkönigs ambition , so zerfressen of greed , he only has his own advantage .
please , please !
we can , and that &apos;s true for all of us , not beschuldigen .
and let &apos;s not forget : it was girion , the fürst of thal .
yes , mr. .
we all know the story .
arrow around arrow has shot .
each verfehlte is his goal .
you &apos;re not right .
no right to enter this mountain .
i &apos;ve got that right .
i &apos;m talking to the mayor of seestadt .
do you want the prediction to be accomplished ?
do you want to participate in the great wealth of our people ?
what do you tell ?
i say to you ...
welcome !
welcome !
and 3-mal welcome , king under the mountains !
by the way , we &apos;re too little .
where is bofur ?
if it &apos;s not here , let &apos;s leave it back .
that &apos;s what we need to do when we want to find the door in front of the night .
we can &apos;t lose time anymore .
you don &apos;t .
we need to be a hurry .
you would stop us .
it also has to deal with it .
what do you talk about , of course , with me .
no .
i &apos;m going to be there when that door comes up .
when we first see the halls of our fathers , thorin .
kili . stay here .
shut out .
come on when you &apos;re healthy .
i &apos;m staying with boys .
the verwundeten are my duty .
uncle .
we grew up with stories on the mountain .
you told them .
you can tell him that .
don &apos;t take away !
fili .
i wear him if it must be .
one day you will be king and understand .
i can &apos;t put the fate of this project for a dwarf .
not for my nephews .
fili , don &apos;t be a narr .
you gehörst to the community .
i &apos;m one of my brother .
in my barte , it &apos;s so late ?
ah !
so now , we break up with our goodwill and best wish .
and please your return ...
wait !
... happiness .
goodbye !
out of the way !
no !
ha .
did you miss the boat ?
kili ?
kili !
no .
from zwergen i have enough .
disappears !
no , no , no !
please !
nobody wants to help us .
kili is sick .
very sick .
what is this place ?
once again , this was the city thal .
it &apos;s a ruine now .
it &apos;s just smaugs einöde .
the sun is soon reaching their zenit .
we have to find the secret door in the mountain before it stops .
along here .
wait !
is this the aussichtsposten ?
gandalf said we should meet here .
no , no , we should ...
do you see him ?
we can &apos;t wait for the magician .
we &apos;ve been asking ourselves .
come on !
dol guldur .
the hügel of magic .
it looks completely outside .
it &apos;s intentional .
a zauberbann tarnt of this place , which means our enemy is not ready to show themselves .
he hasn &apos;t got his full strength yet .
radagast , überbring a message to ms. galadriel .
tell us , we need to force it to act .
how do you mean that ?
i go alone .
and in no case , you can follow me .
do i have your word ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah !
wait , gandalf !
maybe that &apos;s a trap !
go and don &apos;t come back !
it &apos;s certainly a trap .
see what ?
nothing !
if the map is true , the secret door is right over us .
up here !
you have sharp eyes , bilbo beutlin .
this must be her .
the secret door .
should all of you regret that day , regret .
so then .
we have a key thing .
that means there &apos;s also a schlüsselloch .
the last beam in the durinstag is going to be on the schlüsselloch .
nori .
the light schwindet .
power .
silence !
i don &apos;t hear anything if you &apos;re talking about it .
i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s not here !
it &apos;s not here !
schlagt it .
yes !
go ahead .
doch !
it has to break !
that &apos;s nothing .
the door is sealed .
you don &apos;t come with violence .
a powerful magic is on that .
no !
... your last beam on the durinstag hinabfallen is on the schlüsselloch .
this is what it says .
what have we missed ?
what have we missed ?
balin ?
the light is continued .
we can &apos;t do anything more .
we just had this one attempt .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s over .
wait a minute . wa ...
we were too late .
where do they want to go ?
you won &apos;t give up to people .
thorin .
you can &apos;t give up .
imagine the gray rock when the drossel hits .
the untergehende sun lässt its last beam of durinstag .
the last beam .
the last beam .
the last beam !
the schlüsselloch !
come back !
come back !
it &apos;s the light of the moon .
the last herbstmondes !
ha , ha , ha .
where is the key ?
where is it ?
he was here .
oh , he was ...
he was there .
he was still there ...
erebor .
thorin .
i know these walls .
these halls .
this stone .
do you remember , balin ?
chambers filled with goldenem light .
i remember .
there &apos;s the seventh kingdom , home by durins people .
may the heart of the mountain combine all the zwerge to defend this home .
the königsthron .
ah .
and what about that ?
the arkenstein .
the arkenstein .
and what is that ?
that &apos;s the reason why you &apos;re here .
can you do nothing at all ?
i need herbs .
something to lower his fever .
i have nachtschatten .
i have hundskamille .
they don &apos;t use me .
don &apos;t you have a königskraut ?
no , that &apos;s unkraut .
so we feed the pigs .
pigs ?
unkraut .
exactly .
don &apos;t get off the spot .
you want me to find a edelstein ?
a big white edelstein .
yeah .
that &apos;s all ?
there &apos;s certainly a lot down there .
there &apos;s only one arkenstein . and you &apos;ll see it when you see it .
ah .
the truth is , boy , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to find down there .
you don &apos;t have to go if you don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s not unehrenhaft , umzukehren .
no , balin .
i promised i would do it , and i think i should try .
it always erstaunt me .
what ?
the guts of hobbits .
now , with all of the happiness you can express .
ach ?
if you were to actually be a living kite down there , don &apos;t wecke it .
where is your gentleman ?
where is he ?
sauron !
hello ?
it &apos;s not home .
not home .
um .
good .
all right , good , good .
what is that ?
pscht . pscht .
arkenstein .
arkenstein .
a big white edelstein .
very helpful .
so , you know ?
dieb , i can smell you .
i can hear your breath .
i feel you &apos;re here .
where are you ?
where are you ?
come . not so shy .
come on the light .
yeah .
there &apos;s something about you .
something you wear with you .
something from gold .
but it &apos;s a much greater treasure .
darling !
darling !
ah , there you go , dieb , wandelt .
i didn &apos;t intend to bestehlen you . oh , you get extraordinary richer .
i just wanted to vergewissern your glory .
to see if you &apos;re really as big as the old stories tell .
i didn &apos;t believe it .
now do you think it ?
in fact , all songs and they &apos;re going to stay far behind your ungeheuerlichkeit . oh , you &apos;re unermesslicher .
do you think schmeicheleien will save your life ?
no , no .
no , indeed .
my name seems to be aware of you , but i can &apos;t entsinnen myself , like you &apos;d smell .
who are you ? and where do you come from when i get asked ?
i come from the bühl .
under the bühl ?
yeah , and my journey also led me to untern mountain and übern mountain .
and ...
and the skies also .
i &apos;m the wandelnde invisible .
impressive .
what else would you like to be ?
i &apos;m a ...
glück-glücksbringer .
rätsel-rätsellöser .
allerliebst , that title .
go ahead .
fassreiter .
drums ?
that &apos;s interesting .
and what about your little zwergenfreunden ?
where do they hide ?
zwergenfreunde ?
no .
no .
no , zwerge are not here .
you have misunderstood .
oh , i don &apos;t think fassreiter !
they sent you to leave the dangerous work , while they &apos;re out there .
in fact , you irrst , oh , smaug , you ehrwürdigste and entsetzlichste of all disasters .
you have good manieren for a celebration and a liar !
i know the smell and the taste of zwergen .
i don &apos;t know anything better !
it &apos;s the gold .
they &apos;re attracted by estimate like flies from totem meat .
do you think i didn &apos;t know that day ?
that a meute heuchlerischer zwerge comes to the mountain ?
was that an earthquake ?
that , my boy , was a kite .
dad ?
this is from the mountain .
you should disappear .
take your kids .
continues from here .
and where ?
we can nowhere .
will we die , dad ?
no , darling .
the dragon .
he will kill us all .
not when i first kill him .
the king under the mountains is dead .
i took his thron , and i was sick of his people , like a wolf under sheep .
i &apos;ll kill where i want , and when i want to .
my tank is like iron .
no blade can penetrate me .
all right , further .
a black arrow ?
why have you never told me ?
because you don &apos;t know it .
now i &apos;m happy to listen .
you have to ablenken the guards .
as soon as i &apos;m up on the tower , i put the arrow in the bow .
there he is !
bard !
there we go ! go !
grabs him !
fast ! go down there .
run !
hold him !
hold him !
stop !
bain !
bain .
hiding it good .
nobody can find it .
i &apos;m going to finish with them .
i &apos;m not going to leave you alone .
now , go !
braga .
you &apos;re under arrest .
what do you do ?
all the mayor is genehm .
where is he .
where does it leave ?
we still leave him .
time ? what ?
to get killed ?
you fürchtest .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid .
i fear you .
this honey is suspended by a disease .
she pushed your grandfather up into madness .
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
you &apos;re not yourself .
the thorin i know would not be zögern , go in ...
i don &apos;t riskiere this unternehmung for the life of a diebes .
bilbo .
his name is bilbo .
it &apos;s eichenschild . it &apos;s zwerg and thronräuber .
he sent you . he wants the arkenstein , right ?
no .
no , no . i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t bemüh it .
i &apos;ve had his bad intention a long time ago .
but that &apos;s meaningless .
eichenschilds unternehmung is going to fail .
the darkness breaks in .
it passes in every corner of the country .
dieb , put it in the shadow . you &apos;re nothing more than a means for purpose .
the geneticists eichenschild the value of their life , and it affected it as a wertlos .
no .
no .
no , you lügst .
what &apos;s he promised you ?
a percentage of the treasure ?
he would belong to him .
i &apos;m not going to separate from a single coin .
no one piece of it .
my teeth are schwerter .
my claws are spears .
my wings is a hurricane !
so it &apos;s true .
the black arrow has found its goal .
what did you say ?
i just said that your reputation voraus you , oh , smaug .
in fact , nobody will get you right in the world .
it lockt me almost to leave him .
and it &apos;s just to see how eichenschild suffers .
see how it destroyed it .
see how it sein its heart , and it drives it into madness .
but rather than .
our little spielchen ends here .
so tell me , dieb , what do you want to do for a death ?
no .
dad ?
are you , dad ?
ah !
come down here !
down !
you all killed .
there are more .
tauriel .
come .
he &apos;s not holding longer .
tauriel .
athelas .
athelas .
what do you do ?
i forbid it before death .
you live .
not very long .
do you have the arkenstein ?
the arkenstein !
the dragon is coming .
did you find it ?
we need to get out here .
thorin .
thorin .
you &apos;re going to burn up !
run !
ah !
come on , bilbo !
come on .
hold it up .
ah !
tilda .
pscht , pscht , pscht !
we &apos;ve probably abgeschüttelt him .
no .
he &apos;s gerissen .
now where ?
in the western wachkammer .
there may be a result .
it &apos;s too high .
that creates it creating this .
we don &apos;t .
that &apos;s the only way .
we need to try it .
come on .
i &apos;ve heard about the wonders of elbischen medicine .
it was a great honor to see that .
tauriel .
lies out .
you can &apos;t be it .
it &apos;s far away .
it &apos;s far , far away from me .
it passes in the starlight of another world .
it was just a dream .
do you think she could love me ?
stay together .
here it ends .
there &apos;s no way out here .
the last of our sippe .
they have to come from , because they had hope where there was no more .
we could try to reach the mines .
and then maybe we &apos;ll stay a few days .
no .
that &apos;s how i won &apos;t die .
kauernd .
breath for breath .
we go to the back .
he &apos;ll see us . todsicher .
it &apos;s not when we divide .
thorin , we never can .
some of us may .
lockt smaug to the beginning .
we kill the dragon .
when it ends in the fire , then we &apos;re untergehen in it .
here !
flieht .
flieht .
run your life .
you can &apos;t hide you .
behind you !
worm !
come on !
run !
hey , you !

thorin .

thorin !
hold !
thorin !
go .
go !
our plan is not going on .
these öfen are freezing freezing .
he &apos;s right .
we don &apos;t have fire that &apos;s hot enough to spark it .
maybe .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;re so easily überlisten .
you &apos;re slowly . and fat . you &apos;re altersschwach .
in deckung .
now !
bombur !
bring the blasebälge into gang .
go !
bilbo !
up there !
on my sign , you ziehst the lever down .
balin !

come on !
we don &apos;t have a moment .
where is the sulfur ?
do you know what you &apos;re doing ?
go !
now !
lockt him into the ahnenhalle of kings .
further , bilbo !
run !
do you think you could deceive me , fassreiter ?
you come from the seestadt .
this is some guy dummer von from the dirty zwergen and the prius fassverhökerern of the lake .
these jämmerlichen feiglinge with their langbögen and black darts .
maybe it &apos;s time for me to visit you .
oh no .
you can &apos;t do anything .
wait !
you cannot be darfst !
you have something to do , right ?
good .
then look how they die .
here !
you einfältiger worm .
you !
i get back what you stole .
you &apos;re not going to take me anything .
i &apos;ve once niedergestreckt your warriors .
i put the peoples in fear and horror .
i &apos;m king under the mountains .
this is not your kingdom .
this is zwergenland .
this is zwergengold .
and we get our revenge .
revenge ?
revenge ?
i &apos;ll show you what revenge is !
listen to me !
don &apos;t you know what &apos;s going to come from ?
i &apos;m a fire .
i &apos;m the death .
what did we do ?
i warned you .
didn &apos;t i warning you what happens when you get rid of zwergen ?
now you &apos;ve done it .
they &apos;ve dug up the dragon and gebracht death and verderben over us !
power .
quick .

i finally want to get to security .

tauriel .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
i think there is .
once again !
behaltet him .
as a promise .
they &apos;re dry .
you will need them .
thank you .
here .
give me one of these .
in this cold , i get death .
get one !
you have nothing to say , alfrid leckspuckel .
there you go .
is the mayor outside , the power is about his deputy , and that &apos;s me .
and now give me the ceiling !
stellvertretender mayor ?
i don &apos;t laugh .
gerissener dieb makes it better .
i prefer to die as you will .
maybe it &apos;s going to set up .
don &apos;t turn to euresgleichen , alfrid .
not now .
dad !
come here !
you live .
everything is good , my love .
it was bard !
he killed the dragon !
i saw ' &apos;s eyes .
he &apos;s got the bestie erlegt !
with a black arrow , he &apos;s done it .
thank you , bard ! thank you !
well done .
thank you !
you all saved us !
we thank you .
a high on the drachentöter !
up to king bard !
i &apos;ve often said it .
this is a man from edlem home .
an born leader !
it doesn &apos;t call me .
i &apos;m not the mayor of this city .
where is he ?
the mayor !
shut away .
with all our money . no doubt .
you know .
you have the schatzkammer .
geplündert .
no .
i tried to stop it .
liars !
dieb !
you räudiger !
i have gebettelt .
i have gefleht .
let &apos;s make him the garaus !
teert him !
think about the kids .
hang him !
does no one think about the kids ?
ah !
he &apos;s supposed to hang .
he &apos;s supposed to hang .
make it down !
enough !
let &apos;s go there !
let &apos;s go there !
just look around you .
don &apos;t you still have enough of death ?
the winter is before .
we need to care about it .
by the sick and the hilflosen .
you can get injured .
and who is still in powers , i follow .
we need to save , so much we can .
and then ?
so what do we do ?
search zuflucht .
hello !
bombur ?
bifur ?
anyone ?
wait !
wait !
this is bilbo !
he lives !
stop !
stop !
stop .
you have to get away right here .
we all need to go here .
we &apos;re just coming .
i tried to talk to him , but he doesn &apos;t hear .
what do you mean , boy ?
thorin !
thorin .
thorin .
he &apos;s down there for days .
he doesn &apos;t sleep .
he &apos;s not eating anything else .
he &apos;s no longer him .
not at least .
it &apos;s in this place .
a disease seems to be on it .
disease ?
what a disease ?
fili .
fili !
fili !
gold .
gold beyond all the idea .
beyond grief and gram .
look at it , the powerful treasure of thror .
welcome my schwestersöhne . the kingdom erebor .
balin !
kili !
thank you , you live !
bombur !
you live .
do you have anything ?
nothing else .
here &apos;s nothing .
go on .
this stone could be everywhere .
the arkenstein is in these halls .
find him !
you &apos;ve heard ' .
go on .
you all !
nobody lies until it &apos;s found .
it lockt me almost to leave him .
and it &apos;s just to see how eichenschild suffers .
see how it destroyed it .
see how it sein its heart , and it drives it into madness .
i help you .
just take the nötigste .
we have a long march ahead .
where do you go ?
there &apos;s only one place .
the mountain .
you &apos;re big , bless .
we can search in the mountain .
maybe smell something for dragon , but the women clean up .
there we have safe , warm and dry , and we have supplies . beds , clothing and a little gold .
the gold in this mountain is cursed .
we just take what we promised .
what we need for our new lives .
here .
let &apos;s do something .
the message of smaugs death will quickly spread .
yeah .
others will look at their way to the mountain , because of its wealth , and its location .
what do you know ?
nothing .
i &apos;m afraid what happens .
waldland-elben !
the königssohn and the elbenweib are followed by seestadt .
you &apos;ve seen something out there .
the ork i &apos;ve been following in the seestadt , i know who he is .
bolg , a spross of azog , the schänder .
a warg-meute on the edge of esgaroths was waiting for him .
they fled the north .
these orks were different .
you put a sign that i haven &apos;t seen for a long time .
the sign gundabads .
gundabad ?
a ork-festung , up in the north of the nebelgebirges .
my lord legolas .
then my father , where no place is for tauriel , is no place for me .
legolas .
it &apos;s your king command .
yes , he &apos;s my king , but he didn &apos;t gebietet about my heart .
i go north . do you come to me ?
where ?
after gundabad .
the sterblichen , 24 / 7 .
i &apos;m not alone .
does her help , woman galadriel ?
you should have stayed dead .
mithrandir , come back .
he &apos;s here .
yeah .
the dark is back .
gandalf !
gandalf !
get up !
it &apos;s weak .
he &apos;s not allowed to hierbleiben .
it zehrt his life .
flieht !
fast !
comes with me , woman galadriel .
flieht !
you don &apos;t have a power here , servant by morgoth .
you &apos;re namenlos .
gesichtslos .
gestaltlos .
back into the emptiness that you came back from !
the mind has survived .
but it was displaced .
it &apos;s going to escape . in the east .
gondor must be warning .
they have to wake up on the borders .
no .
care about herrin galadriel .
it &apos;s used a lot of its power .
their strength schwindet .
bring it to lothlórien .
my lord saruman .
he &apos;s got to go to the track and get wiped out for everyone .
without the ring of power , sauron can never again reach the rule of mittelerde .
all right .
überlasst sauron me .
i need a horse .
what ?
gandalf .
where do you want to go ?
erebor .
you don &apos;t know what to do .
i saw her with her eyes . row around row . moria-orks .
versammle our friends . birds and animals .
the battle around the mountain is going to start soon .
he &apos;s here in these halls .
i know it .
we have all abgesucht .
not so hard enough .
thorin , we all wish we &apos;d take the rock back .
and yet he &apos;s not found !
do you zweifelst at the ergebenheit of any one here ?
the arkenstein is the birthright of our people .
he &apos;s the königsjuwel .
am i not the king ?
notice you .
should somebody find him and miss him .
meet my revenge .
drachenkrankheit .
i &apos;ve seen that .
this view .
the terrible desire .
it &apos;s a wild and neidvolle love , bilbo .
she pushed his grandfather into the wahn .
balin , if thorin had the arkenstein , if ... if he found ...
this rock is the genesis of everything .
he &apos;s the pinnacle of all wealth here , and gives them a force that &apos;s carrying it .
would he make his madness wahnsinn gebieten ?
no , my boy .
i fear it would be worse .
maybe it &apos;s better , it &apos;s lost .
what is that ?
in your hand .
that &apos;s nothing .
show me ' .
it ...
i put them in beorns garden .
you brought them to this ?
i plant them in my backyard .
in beutelsend .
a fairly small memory for the auenland .
it becomes a tree .
and if i look at it , i &apos;ll remember .
on everything that &apos;s happened , the good thing , the evil , and fortunately to have it home .
thorin , i ...
thorin .
survivors of seestadt . they &apos;re strömen into thal .
to hundreds .
call everyone to the gate .
the door !
immediately !
come on .
go on .
lord !
lord !
here !
see , mr. !
the feuerschalen burn .
so thorin eichenschild and his gefolge survived .
survive ?
you mean , there &apos;s a bunch of zwerge on all the gold ?
don &apos;t worry , alfrid .
in the mountain , there &apos;s enough gold for everyone .
here &apos;s the nachtlager .
get a shelter .
and make some fire .
so , you hurry . you go .
alfrid .
her übernehmt übernehmt .
up with that !
all right .
i &apos;d like to knit the festung to sunrise .
erobern the mountain was hard .
i don &apos;t even leave him again .
the seestadt people have nothing more .
they come to us .
all they had was lost .
don &apos;t tell me what you lost .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with me .
the drachenfeuer have survived , should be happy .
they have all the reason to be grateful .
more stones .
get more rocks to gateway !
we would have that .
these kids are hungry .
we need what to eat .
we don &apos;t think about three days .
bard .
we don &apos;t have enough .
what you can do , peredur .
everything gets good .
don &apos;t worry .
we need more water .
children , hurt and women go .
here . trink .
good morning , alfrid .
anything happened at night ?
all right , lord .
nothing happens .
don &apos;t miss me .
except an army of elben , like me .
my lord thranduil . we have you here .
not expected .
i heard you need help .
here , take it !
keep it going !
one more !
you &apos;ve saved us .
i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
your gratitude is unnecessary .
i &apos;m not euretwegen here .
i &apos;m going to come up with something that belongs to me .
and in this mountain , there are edelsteine , which i begehre .
white stones from pure light .
the white stones from lasgalen .
i know a elbenfürsten that would pay a proud price for it .
wait !
please , wait !
you go to war because of a handful of edelsteine ?
the erbstücke of my people won &apos;t give up .
we have the same goal .
my people also have a claim to the reichtümer in this mountain .
let me talk about thorin .
you want to negotiate with the dwarf ?
to prevent a war ?
yeah .
not a bad job for a night .
come on .
are gegrüßt , thorin , son of thrain .
that you &apos;re alive , we don &apos;t hope to hope .
why are you in kriegsrüstung on the gate of the king under the mountains ?
why are the king under the mountains like a predator in the cave ?
maybe because i expect to be robbed .
my lord to paste you is not here . just to get a simple kind of reasoning .
don &apos;t you want to talk to me ?
i hear .
in the name of the seestadt , i &apos;m telling you to keep your word .
a fraction of the treasure so you can neu your life .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with anybody as long as an army in front of my gate .
this army in weapons will attack the mountain if we won &apos;t agree .
your drohungen don &apos;t impress me .
and yours ?
does it not tell you that our cause is rechtens ?
my people helped you .
and , thanks to that , you don &apos;t have to get them down to verderben and death .
when have the people ever helped themselves to be rewarded without the rich ?
we have a bargain .
a deal ?
what could we do when our birthright to verschachern and food ?
as our freedom to buy with our future ?
that &apos;s called a gerechten trade ?
tell me , &quot; tell me .
bard , the drachentöter , why would i recognize these rules ?
because you gave us your word .
does it mean nothing ?
disappears !
before our arrows fly !
what do you do ?
you can &apos;t run war .
you can &apos;t do that .
sorry , but if you haven &apos;t noticed it , a elbenheer is down there before the gate .
just to mention hundreds of zorniger fishermen .
we &apos;re clearly in the unterzahl .
no longer very long .
what does that mean ?
that means master beutlin , you should never underestimate zwerge .
we have the erebor back .
and now we defend him .
he &apos;s going to give us nothing .
a jammer .
after all , after all , after all .
you &apos;ve tried .
i don &apos;t understand .
why ?
why is he embracing a war ?
to negotiate with them is müßig .
they only understand one .
we reach on sunrise .
are you at our side ?
yeah .
champion beutlin , come here .
that could be useful .
put it on .
this shirt was forged by silberstahl .
mithril , it &apos;s called my ancestors .
no blade can penetrate it .
i look ridiculous .
i &apos;m not a warrior , i &apos;m a hobbit .
it &apos;s a gift .
a sign of our friendship .
real friends are rarely found .
i was blind , but now i see again .
you have told me .
tell ?
the arkenstein .
one of them stole him .
one of them is a betrüger .
thorin ... the task is full . you &apos;ve got the mountain back .
isn &apos;t that enough ?
you know , from my own people .
no , um -- you gave the people a promise to people .
is this treasure more value than your honor ?
our honor , our honor .
i was there .
i &apos;ve given my word .
and i &apos;m grateful for that .
but the treasure in this mountain is not the people from the seestadt .
this is the gold .
we are alone .
in my life , i &apos;m not going to be a single one .
separate coin .
no one &apos;s even that little piece of it .
gundabad .
what &apos;s it about ?
an old enemy .
the past kingdom angmar .
this festung once was the bollwerk .
this was their big waffenkammern .
her kriegsgerät was forged .
a light .
something has moved .
we &apos;re waiting for protecting the night .
this is a evil place , tauriel .
in another age , our people led war on this land .
my mother died there .
my father doesn &apos;t talk about it .
there is no grave .
no memory .
nothing .
ah !
let me go through !
out of the way !
no , no .
no !
hey !
you !
spitzhut !
yeah .
we don &apos;t want rumtreiber , bettler , even vagabunden .
we also have without euresgleichen enough .
with you .
get on your gaul .
who has this saying ?
who wants to know ?
you must have your kleinlichen zwist with the zwergen beilegen .
there will be war !
the cesspools dol guldurs exploded .
you &apos;re all in deadly danger .
what do you talk about ?
i see you don &apos;t know anything about zauberern .
they &apos;re like a wintergewitter that heranrollt on a rasenden wind , then bringen bad customers .
but sometimes a storm is just a storm .
not that time .
ork-heere back .
they are kämpfer .
they were grown for war .
our enemy has gathered all its forces .
now why should he show up ?
because we have forced him .
back then , as thorin eichenschild aufbrach to bring back his home .
the zwerge should never reach the erebor .
azog was sent to kill her .
his lord wants to bring the mountain into his violence .
it &apos;s not just because of the schatzes , but its strategic position .
this is the gateway to the rückeroberung of the country in north america .
now , this dark kingdom goes again , bruchtal , lórien , the auenland , even gondor untergehen .
these ork-heere that you &apos;re talking about , mithrandir , where are you ?
this fools .
if we hineinwollen , we should go now .
these bats are being grown into a cause .
what ?
for war .
when is my advice going to be so geringgeschätzt ?
what do you think i &apos;m talking about ?
i think you want to save your zwergenfreunde , and i will admiration your treue to you .
but it doesn &apos;t take me off , from my course .
you &apos;ve begun , mithrandir .
verzeiht me when i close it .
are the bogenschützen in the corner ?
yeah , sir .
erteilt .
if anything on this mountain comes , it kills .
the time of zwerge is around .
you go ! bogenschütze !
are you okay with that ?
is gold so important to you ?
do you erkauft it with the blood of zwergen ?
it won &apos;t come .
that struggle you can &apos;t win .
it won &apos;t stop it .
do you think the zwerge are coming up ?
never .
they &apos;re fighting to death for their cause .
bilbo beutlin .
if i don &apos;t fake myself , this is the halbling , which has stolen the key to my verliesen in front of my guards .
yeah .
please excuse me .
i &apos;ve come to give you this .
the heart of the mountain .
the königsjuwel .
and royal auslöse &apos;s worth .
how does it come to its property ?
this is my vierzehntel share of the treasure .
why do you do that ?
they don &apos;t schuldet us .
i don &apos;t do that for you .
i know zwerge can be starrsinnig and dickköpfig and difficult .
misstrauisch and heimlichtuerisch and the worst manieren that you can imagine , but they &apos;re also tapfer and gütig and infinitely true .
i closed her in the heart , and i want to save her if i can .
thorin is more value than anything else .
in order to tell him , he &apos;ll certainly give you what he schuldet you .
so there &apos;s no reason for war .
hang on tonight .
you have to break tomorrow .
what ?
go from here as far as possible .
i &apos;m not going to go .
you &apos;ve made me go to the vierzehnten man .
i &apos;m not going to leave the business .
there &apos;s no unternehmung .
no longer .
not come from what thorin does when he experiences this .
i &apos;m not afraid of thorin .
you should .
never unterschätze evil in the gold .
you know , gold , on which one feuer-schlange gelegen .
the drachenkrankheit goes into the hearts of everybody who gets close to the mountain .
almost everybody .
ha .
you do .
so this hobbit is looking at a bed and filling his stomach with warmem food .
he deserves it .
hey .
behaltet him in the eye .
if it wants to disappear , it tells me .
you go .
stupid hobbit .
up , up , hobbit !
out of the feathers !
next , you hit your eyes .
we come to tell you that the begleichung of your blame is offered and adopted .
what begleichung ?
i &apos;ve given you nothing .
you have nothing .
we have this .
they have the arkenstein .
diebe !
how does the erbstück of our house come into your hands ?
this stone belongs to the king !
and the king should get him . with our goodwill .
but first , he has to stand to his word .
they want to be fooled .
this is just a list .
a dirty lie .
the arkenstein is hidden in this mountain !
this is a deception .
no , that &apos;s not a deception .
the stone is real .
i gave him .
you ?
i took him as my vierzehnten part .
you stole him ?
stolen ?
no .
no , it may be that i &apos;m a dieb , but i &apos;m a honest one , i suggest .
i &apos;m ready to get rid of my demands .
on your demands ?
your demands .
you don &apos;t have any claims to me , you &apos;re lousy .
i wanted to give him .
many times i wanted it , but ...
but what do you fry ?
you changed you , thorin .
the dwarf i met in beutelsend would have never broken his word .
never would have the treue of his gezweifelt .
you &apos;re not talking to me about treue .
werft it down wall !
don &apos;t you hear me ?
then i do it myself .
no !
noa shalt be , and the wizard .
that &apos;s got us forced .
if you &apos;re not satisfied with my meisterdieb , please do nothing .
give him back to me .
so far , as king , you don &apos;t have a very good figure , right ? thorin , son of thrain .
i don &apos;t want to have anything to do with zauberern ...
now go !
... and auenlandratten !
let &apos;s agree ?
the rückgabe of the arkensteins against what was promised ?
give us your answer .
do you want peace or war ?
i want war .
eisenfuß .
who is that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy .
this is dain , the lord of the eisenberge .
thorins thorins thorins
vetter .
are you similar ?
for me , thorin was always the vernünftigere of both .
good morning .
how do we allerseits ?
i would have had a little proposal if you were to give me a moment of your time .
you kind of freundlich and disappears from here !
you all !
and it &apos;s immediately !
hold the post !
oh , but not yet , fürst dain .
gandalf of gray .
say this gesindel , it &apos;s supposed to disappear , otherwise i &apos;m going to get the floor with your blood .
a war between zwergen , people and elben is unnecessary .
an army from orks march to the mountain .
hold your strength back .
i don &apos;t think so much back .
and not before that ehrlosen waldland-kobold .
he only wants the worst to my people .
and he should ask me between me and my sippe .
and then i beat him his nice skull .
let &apos;s see if he &apos;s still smiling .
he &apos;s as irrsinnig as his vetter .
does you hear , friends ?
it goes !
let &apos;s miss the dreckskerlen a ordentliche !
werwürmer .
you don &apos;t have ' .
the horden of darkness is going .
in the battle !
in the battle , sons durins !
i klettere the wall down .
who comes with me ?
i come with , brother !
yes ! let &apos;s go !
put the gun down .
no .
shouldn &apos;t we do anything ?
i said , hold the gun down !
the elben .
don &apos;t they fight ?
thranduil !
that &apos;s insane !
attack !
yes !
uh , gandalf ?
is the ratsam to stand here ?
azog .
he wants to separate us from the others .
all herhören !
retreat to thal !
now !
in the city !
bilbo !
here !
sigrid !
tilda !
my kids !
where are my children ?
i saw them !
down to the old market !
the market ?
where are they now ?
tilda !
sigrid !
bard !
orks storms about the dammweg .
the bogenschützen to the eastern brustwehr .
hold up until you can .
protect !
here !
the orks have taken the steinstraße !
the market is überrannt !
everybody else , follow me !
attack !
forward !
up to death !
dad !
dad !
here !
down here !
bain !
sigrid !
duckt you !
listen !
i want you to zusammenruft all the women and children .
then she puts her into the big hall and verbarrikadiert the gate .
did you understand ?
and there &apos;s no way back .
we want to stay with you !
you want to pursue your father .
überlasst me , lord .
you &apos;ve heard him .
we go to big hall .
alfrid !
only women and children .
i need every man to fight .
come back .
i &apos;m teaching you in security , sir .
then i get my sword for you .
stand up !
give eight to you . -- i &apos;ll do that .
abmarsch , mütterchen !
walk into the big hall !
out of the way !
let the krüppel back !
her mistkerle !
where is thorin ?
we need it !
where is he ?
pull back .
when do we keep our own people ?
thorin ... they die out there .
there are halls around that mountain .
places that we attach can enhance , secure .
yeah . yeah . that &apos;s it .
we have to lower the gold below the earth .
bringen .
did you hear ?
dain is umstellt .
they become geschlachtet .
many die in war .
life is worthless .
but a treasure like this doesn &apos;t aufwiegen into lost life .
it &apos;s worth it . it &apos;s worth all of the blood that we spill .
you &apos;re sitting here in these enormous halls , and you wear a starry crown , but you &apos;re better than you &apos;ve ever been .
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m any unbedeutender zwergenfürst . i &apos;m still ...
thorin thorin thorin
eichenschild .
i &apos;m your king !
you were always my king .
and you used to know that .
you don &apos;t see what &apos;s gotten out of you .
go .
verschwinde .
before i umbringe you .
you sit here and you wear a crown on your head .
you &apos;re better than you &apos;ve ever been .
a treasure , like this , doesn &apos;t aufwiegen with a lost life .
this honey is suspended by a disease .
it &apos;s a blind ambition .
am i not the king ?
this is the gold .
let &apos;s do it . ourselves .
i &apos;m not going to separate from a single coin .
he &apos;s only got his own advantage in mind .
as if i had some unbedeutender zwergenfürst .
thorin eichenschild .
she pushed your grandfather up into madness .
this is thorin , son of thrain , son of thror .
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
you &apos;re the legacy of durins thron .
they die ... die .
erobert the erebor .
dain is umstellt .
die .
is umstellt .
die .
get your home back .
you changed you , thorin .
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
is this treasure more value than your honor ?
i &apos;m not my grandfather .
the honey will be your death !
retreat !
retreat ! to the mountain !
retreat !
now comes your end .
i &apos;m not going to hide behind a wall of rock while others go to battle .
this is not in my blood , thorin .
no .
truly not .
we are durins durins .
and durins people don &apos;t fight any fight .
i don &apos;t have a right to ask that from you .
but do you want to follow me ? one last time ?
thorin .
for the king !
for the king !
the zwerge .
they go to fight .
on the side of her king .
every man who &apos;s willing to give everything , follow me !
we are facing our men in life , so in death .
i come .
armed you .
come on with us , mütterchen .
no , no , no .
-- let me get old weib in peace .
no fear .
i said , let me !
alfrid leckspuckel .
what are you going to do for chicken ?
ein ?
not every man would be courageous enough to wear a korsett .
you &apos;re not a man .
you &apos;re a wiesel .
dain !
thorin !
stop !
i come !
hey , vetter !
where do you put that long ?
it &apos;s too many of these mistkerlen , thorin .
i hope you have a plan .
yeah .
we vernichten their leaders .
azog ?
i &apos;m going to kill this piece trash .
forward !
maybe we &apos;re going to survive .
gandalf !
this is thorin .
and fili , kili and dwalin .
he takes his best warrior .
and what do you have ?
the snake abschlagen your head .
die !
gandalf !
legolas .
legolas grünblatt .
a second army is in anmarsch .
bolg führt orks from gundabad .
you &apos;ll get here soon .
gundabad .
that was their plan , from the beginning .
azog grabs us , and then bolg bolg with the orbit of the north .
the north ?
where is the north .
right ?
am .
am ?
thorin is up there .
and fili and kili .
they &apos;re all up there .
where is he ?
looks out .
i think azog is fled .
i don &apos;t think so .
fili ... take your brother .
look at the towers .
let &apos;s not see you and get hurt .
if you look at something , raise your hand .
it doesn &apos;t strike .
huh ?
we get to visit .
ork-söldner .
no more than 100 .
we care about it .
go !
go !
come here !
call your men back .
my lord ! send a trupp to rabenberg .
the zwerge will soon be überrannt .
thorin must be warning .
please , dare it quiet .
i have enough elbenblut for defense of this verfluchten country . end with it .
thranduil ?
i go .
don &apos;t make you ridiculous .
you can never do that .
why not ?
because they &apos;re going to come and kill you .
don &apos;t .
you won &apos;t see me .
it &apos;s not challenging .
i don &apos;t erlaube it .
i &apos;m not asking about permission , gandalf .
you won &apos;t go on .
you won &apos;t avert you .
not that time .
go out of the way .
you become the zwerge slaughter .
yes , they will die .
today , tomorrow , in a year or 100 years of today .
what does that mean ?
they &apos;re sterblich .
you hold your life more value than your life , although there &apos;s no love in it .
there &apos;s no love in you .
what do you know about love ?
nothing .
what you &apos;re doing for this dwarf is not real .
you think it &apos;s love ?
are you ready to die for that ?
if you do something , you will have to kill me .
i come with you .
stand up .
get away from me .
i don &apos;t gehorche you .
people are familiar with you .
have heard of you .
the cape &apos;s cape was right . and you &apos;ve gone away .
what ?
alfrid ... you see the unterrock .
no .
stay here .
go further down .
i can do this .
where is this dirty ork ?
thorin .
bilbo .
you have to go here .
immediately .
azog has a second army to attack north .
this wachturm is surrounded .
and nobody entkommt .
we &apos;re so close .
this widerliche ork is in there .
let &apos;s get it .
no .
that &apos;s exactly what he wants .
he wants to hineinlocken us .
that &apos;s a trap .
ah .
search fili and kili .
call them back .
thorin , are you safe ?
do it .
we fight on another day .
oh ...
first of all , this is dying .
flieht .

mm .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
psst , psst .
ah .
i want to get divorced in your friendship .
no .
you , you don &apos;t go anywhere .
you &apos;re going to live .
i want to take back what i said at the gate .
you &apos;ve done what a true friend does .
forgive me .
i was too blind to see it .
i &apos;m so sorry that i brought you in such a danger .
no , i &apos;m glad i could go through the dangers with you .
i &apos;m happy everybody .
that &apos;s much more than any beutlin humidity .
you know , live .
meisterdieb .
get your books back .
and to your desktop .
pflanz your trees .
look how they grow .
if there would be more to be more alert to home than gold , and this world would be a much more glücklicherer place .
no .
no , no , no .
no .
no , thorin .
don &apos;t wag it .
thorin .
thorin .
thorin , hang on .
hang on .
eagles ...
eagles ...
eagles are there .
thorin ?
the one ...
i can &apos;t go back .
where do you want to go ?
i don &apos;t know .
go north .
search for the dúnedain .
they &apos;re a young waldläufer .
find him .
his father , arathorn , was a good man .
his son could once become a big man .
what &apos;s his name ?
in the wild , it &apos;s called streicher .
his true name will be found for yourself .
legolas .
your mother loved you .
more than anyone .
more than life .
i &apos;d like to bury it .
yeah .
if that &apos;s the love , i don &apos;t want to .
get rid of it .
please .
why just hurt them so much ?
she was truly .
there &apos;s a big spike tonight .
songs are gesungen , telling stories .
and thorin eichenschild will become legend .
i know you must honor this way .
but for me , he never was .
he was ...
for me ... he was ...
i &apos;m quiet of it .
you say the other goodbye ?
why don &apos;t you say it yourself ?
if you go back to beutelsend , uh ... tea is ' .
it &apos;s enough .
you &apos;re welcome at any time .
uh ...
you don &apos;t need anzuklopfen .
ah , the border to auenland .
here i have to leave you .
shame .
it &apos;s quite pleasant when you have a magician .
they seem to be lucky .
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be davongekommen with all your abenteuern with heiler skin .
you cannot use leichtfertig , bilbo .
don &apos;t worry about me .
i know you &apos;ve found one in the orkstollen .
and since then , i have an eye on you .
thank you so much .
live , gandalf .
probably live .
you need you , uh , to make this ring .
he &apos;s like the battle of my pocket .
i lost it .
you &apos;re a very nerdy guy , bilbo beutlin .
and i love you .
but you &apos;re just a little fellow , in the great world .
wait a minute , that &apos;s the aussteuertruhe of my mother .
and this is my chair .
ah ...
take the sitzbank back immediately !
what &apos;s going on here ?
good afternoon .
mr. bilbo .
they &apos;re not supposed to be here .
how do you mean that ?
well , because they &apos;ve been explained for dead and everything .
i &apos;m not dead .
neither nor else explained .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s allowed .
mr. bilbo !
nineteen , 20 ? 21 ?
who goes up to 21 ?
ha , ha .
sell to ms. bolger .
now , dicks feet have finally ein .
do i hear a commandment for this ?
built in auenland .
not the schnöde nachgemachte .
stop !
stop !
that &apos;s a mistake .
who are you ?
what do you want me to be ?
you know exactly who i am .
lobelia sackheim-beutlin .
that &apos;s my home !
and these are my taste .
thank you .
this is highly regelwidrig .
sorry .
it &apos;s been over 13 months since that .
if you actually do .
bilbo beutlin and unverstorben are , can you prove that ?
what ?
well , some paper with your name would be rich .
all right .
good .
the contract to my act as ...
it doesn &apos;t matter .
there .
my signature .
yeah , so uh ...
it seems to have its accuracy .
yeah .
i think there &apos;s no doubt there .
who is this person who has taken their services ?
thorin eichenschild ?
he ...
he was my friend .
no , thank you .
we don &apos;t need any other visitors , gratulanten or distant relatives .
and what about very old friends ?
gandalf ?
bilbo beutlin .
my lieber !
ha , ha !
nice to see you .
111 years .
is that believing ?
come on ! come in !
welcome .
welcome .
